# CLAUDE.md — strategies/python/mpc_sos_fade/ (the MPC SOS Fade bot)

**Purpose:** The MPC SOS Fade strategy in Python — a line-for-line port of the A+ block +
execution layer in `indicators/mpc_strategy.pine` (Aaron's brother's "MPC-JARVIS" script). It reads
the canonical engine stack's per-bar output and turns the A+ sequence into trades.
**Scope:** This strategy only — its state machine, order logic, config, and parity harness. It does
NOT own the engines (`engines/`), the replay runner (`backtest/`), or the lab (`command-center/`).
**Status:** Built + unit-tested + **logic-parity GREEN (exit 0) 2026-07-16** on a full-history
`VANTAGE_XAUUSD, 5m` export (20,076 bars, `compare_strategy.py` with no warmup — the export starts at
bar 0). Bar-for-bar identical decision stream vs `mpc_strategy.pine`. Runs real-tick fills + costs
(`fill_model="tick"`), and is registered in the command-center lab as `runner="python"` (see
`LAB_STRATEGY` in `__init__.py`) — risk % is editable in the Run modal. 51 offline tests green.
**RE-VALIDATED GREEN 2026-07-22** after the Pine changed (SOS-aware veto + `execConfSZ` + CONT
removal): the export was regenerated, the veto was ported, and `compare_strategy.py` matches Pine's
decision stream on a fresh 19,863-bar `VANTAGE_XAUUSD, 15m` grand export — every `px_dec_bits` /
`px_stages` / `px_edge` / `px_entry_price` bar-for-bar, one lone 25-cent `px_exit_run` difference on
a single Nov-2025 runner (an intrabar trail-fill guess, not a decision). See `## The 2026-07-22 re-sync`.
**RE-VALIDATED GREEN 2026-07-29** on a fresh 21,494-bar `VANTAGE_XAUUSD, 15m` export taken at the
shipped `exec_tp1_pct = exec_tp2_pct = 0` and carrying the swing ratchet through `cfg_exitmode`/
`cfg_trail_pct` — exit 0 at warmup 100 and at every warmup up to 2000. See
`### PARITY GREEN 2026-07-29`.
**RE-VALIDATED GREEN 2026-08-02** on a fresh 21,710-bar `VANTAGE_XAUUSD, 15m` export carrying the
new ENTRY MODEL through `cfg_bits` (decoded 544375, **bit 524288 set** = rule 3 live on both sides)
— exit 0 at warmups 100 / 500 / 1000 / 2000. That is the run that validates the port; an export
taken before 2026-08-02 has every new bit clear and proves nothing about it.
**RE-RUN GREEN 2026-08-02 after the label/tooltip sync**, on a FRESH 21,715-bar export taken off the
renamed file (2025-08-31 → 2026-08-02, `cfg_bits` 544375) — exit 0 at warmups 100 / 500 / 1000 /
2000. That change touched Pine input TITLES and tooltips, `config.py` comments and one display
string, so a green run on an export from the NEW file is the evidence it was cosmetic, rather than
an argument that it must have been. The same run is the compile proof: a title is a string literal,
so a mangled one fails to compile, it does not quietly change a trade.

### `mpc_sos_fade.meta.json` — labels and descs are SHARED WITH THE PINE (2026-08-02)

Every `label` in the meta file is byte-identical to that input's title in
`indicators/mpc_strategy.pine`, minus Pine's leading `   ↳ ` indent marker. Every `desc` is that
input's tooltip **verbatim**. One parameter, one name, one explanation, two UIs.

**Change a label or a desc and change the Pine in the same commit.** Otherwise the lab and
TradingView start teaching different things about the same setting, which is exactly how the
old `exec_deep_fib` row came to be labelled "nearest fib ABOVE" — true for a long, wrong for a
short, and contradicting its own Pine tooltip four inches away.

The ONE allowed deviation is a suffix stating something true only of THIS runner: `exec_conf_sz`
reads "Allow Sniper Zone as entry confirmation **(not supported)**" in the lab, because the
Sniper-Zone entry is Pine-only and turning it on changes nothing on a lab run.

Verify with a diff, not by eye — the check is mechanical: pull every `input.*` title out of the
Pine, join on the field name, and compare. As of 2026-08-02 that is **42 of 43 shared params
identical** and **43 of 43 descs identical**.

⚠ **Rename titles, never reorder an `input.*` call.** TradingView keys a chart's saved input
values off declaration order, so a rename carries Aaron's settings forward and a reorder silently
resets them to defaults on every chart he has the script on.
**Open question — sample size, NOT correctness:** the validated 365d 15m run is only 22 trades (2yr:
40), and the runners alone make >100% of the net in both windows. Read `## The 2026-07-16 year run`
below before trusting any tuning done against it.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-02 — **this bot can be charged the SPREAD and the OVERNIGHT SWAP now**,
which are the two costs bar mode always knew and never billed, and it matters here more than on most
strategies because this runner is DESIGNED to hold overnight (deviation 1). Both come from a broker
profile rather than a typed number, behind layers that are **ALL OFF by default** — the baseline run
stays free so it stays comparable to the TradingView Strategy Tester. **MEASURED over 155,431 M15
bars (2020 → 2026-07-31) at the shipped defaults: free 161 trades / 135.94R / $28.26M · +spread
130.27R / $16.27M · +spread+swap 123.90R / $10.09M · bid/ask fills 159 trades / 141.93R / $29.48M.**
⚠ **A small charge is not a small effect — 12.04R of cost turns $28.3M into $10.1M, 64% of the
balance for 9% of the R**, because at fixed % risk a dollar not earned early never compounds; read a
cost against the R, never the net dollars. ⚠ **The bid/ask row is HIGHER than free, and that is what
a limit-entry strategy does with a spread** — every order here names a PRICE, so the spread moves
fill TIMING and lands almost entirely on SHORTS. Full table, the long-vs-short reasoning and the
"treat it as a lab finding" caveat: *Layered costs* below. ✅ The free path reproduces the documented
161 / +135.94R baseline to the cent and `compare_strategy.py` is exit 0. Earlier the same day:
**every trade now RECORDS the fib leg it was priced off, so the lab
chart can draw the exact ladder the entry, stop and targets came from.** Aaron's brother asked to
see, on each plotted trade, the fib run on the points that trade used — i.e. which retracement
levels it went into. `Trade.fib` (a `TradeFib`: the eight `(ratio, price)` pairs plus the bar the
LEG started on) is snapshotted in `_place_entries` onto `_Pending` and carried through
`_open_position` to the closed `Trade`. **REPORTING ONLY**, the same standing as `mfe_usd` / `tp1` /
`tp2` — nothing reads a ladder back, so no decision can move.
⚠ **It is taken at PLACEMENT and read from the ORDER at the fill, never from `sig` again.** A fib is
live and keeps extending while a limit rests, so re-reading it at the fill would report a leg the
order was never priced against — and the stop and targets on that same trade, which ARE frozen at
placement, would then belong to a different ladder from the one drawn beside them
(`test_the_recorded_fib_is_the_one_the_ORDER_rested_on_not_the_one_at_the_fill`).
⚠ **It is a COPY, not a derivation.** The prices are the `fiboP*` values the strategy had in hand;
nothing downstream recomputes them from anchors. A fib rebuilt in the backend or the browser is a
second claim about one leg, which is the failure this repo has now met four times.
⚠ **Recording is all-or-nothing** — a ladder missing a rung is dropped entirely, because seven
levels drawn where there are eight reads as "this trade had no 0.786" rather than "this record is
incomplete". The **1m secondary** records none by design (it rests at a retrace of its own tight 1m
leg, a different fib), and `mpc_bleg` gets none for free (it overrides `_place_entries`).
It needed two fields upstream: `Signals.fibo_ash_ms` / `.fibo_asl_ms`, converted from the fib
engine's new `ash_loc`/`asl_loc` through a bar-index→time table in `SignalAdapter`. ⚠ **Times,
deliberately not bar INDICES** — an index is relative to the window that produced it, and this repo
has already been bitten once by diffing a Pine `bar_index` across two windows (`strategies/CLAUDE.md`
→ the B-LEG harness bug); the chart trims its candles, so only a timestamp survives the trip.
✅ **Proven cosmetic by measurement, not argued:** `compare_strategy.py` **exit 0 at warmups 100 /
500 / 1000 / 2000** on the 21,715-bar `VANTAGE_XAUUSD, 15m` export, `compare_bleg.py` exit 0 at 100
and 800 on the B-LEG export, and the fibonacci engine A/B'd at HEAD vs the working tree over 47,263
real bars with 0 field differences (`engines/fibonacci/CLAUDE.md`). Also validated forward on 23,716
real M15 bars: all 17 trades in 2024 carry a ladder, and their entry ratios independently reproduce
the documented entry model — **0.618 ×5 / 0.702 / 0.786 ×3 exactly on a level (the `_fib_snap`
rules), the rest between levels (gap-edge entries)**, with deepest ratios 0.62–0.98, i.e. never past
the 0.886 stop. 79 tests green here. Earlier the same day: **the 2026-08-02 ENTRY MODEL is ported, and it changes the shipped
default.** Five new config fields, in lockstep with `mpc_strategy.pine`: `exec_fvg_pre_zone` (False),
`exec_fib_overlap` (False), `exec_fib_deep_edge` (False), **`exec_fib_nearest` (True)** and
`exec_sl_deep` (False) — and `exec_deep_fib` flipped **True → False**, because rule 3 replaces it.
⚠ **THAT LAST PAIR MOVES TRADES: the default entry PRICE changed.** Method 3 only ever looked at the
level ABOVE a floating gap, so a gap sitting a hair short of 0.702 was still entered way back at
0.618 (Aaron caught it on the 30 Jul 2026 trade); rule 3 measures BOTH sides and rests on whichever
is closer. Where the deeper level wins, the limit now sits PAST the gap, so it is a deeper entry and
a tighter stop **bought with fill rate** — a setup that only tags the gap and turns no longer fills
at all. **MEASURED on 155,431 cached M15 bars, 2020-01-01 → 2026-07-31: 165 trades / +126.68R
becomes 161 / +135.94R** — the fill-rate cost is real (4 trades gone) and the deeper entries more
than pay for it. That 126.68R baseline reproduces the Pine's own stated figure for the same window
**to the cent**, which is an independent cross-check that this port replays the build the Pine
measurement was taken against. ⚠ **Every other number in this file predates the change.** The rules
CASCADE (`_fib_snap`, Pine `f_fibEntry`):
rule 1 is independent and fires only on a gap whose BODY holds a level; rules 2 / 3 / Method 3 all
answer "where does a FLOATING gap rest?" so each overrides the next. **Every scan stops at 0.786 —
0.886 is the stop, so an entry resting there is a zero stop distance and a cancelled order**, which
is also why no rule here can ever REMOVE a trade. `exec_fvg_pre_zone` needed two new pieces of state
that had no Python home: `Signals.fvgs` is now a **4-tuple carrying each gap's born bar**, and
`Signals.fibo_half_bar` latches the bar price first tagged 0.5 (Pine `fiboHalfBar`, reset with the
leg). It gates **BOTH** gap consumers — the entry-edge loop AND `sequence.py`'s confluence flag —
because a gap the entry may not use must never be reported as the confluence that armed the setup;
add the call to any future reader of `sig.fvgs` or that path becomes a way around the gate.
`_sl_anchor` now takes `(edge, is_bull)` for `exec_sl_deep`, and `_record_blocks` computes it **per
side** rather than once, because the anchor is a function of that side's own entry edge.
⚠ **Two sibling forks had to PIN the old behaviour**, since neither of their Pines has this model:
`BLegConfig` pins all five plus `exec_deep_fib=True` (it does not override `_entry_edges`, and those
edges feed the "A+ has priority" gate, so this is NOT inert there), and `BosConfig` pins
`exec_deep_fib=True`. **Defaults verified mechanically against the Pine, not by eye** — all 23
execution inputs in the panel diffed programmatically, 0 mismatches. 140 tests green (11 new).
✅ **PARITY RE-VALIDATED GREEN THE SAME DAY, and the run is not vacuous.**
`compare_strategy.py "VANTAGE_XAUUSD, 15_cfa13.csv"` → **exit 0 at warmups 100 / 200 / 500 / 1000 /
2000**, 21,702 bars, 2025-08-31 → 2026-08-02. `cfg_bits` gained bits 131072 / 262144 / 524288 /
1048576 / 2097152 (65536 stays RETIRED, never reused) and the export **decoded 544375 — bit 524288
SET** — so the Pine really was running rule 3 and the Python was configured to it from the export,
rather than the two agreeing on a model neither had switched on. That is what makes this the run the
port needed: an export taken before today has all five bits clear, which decodes to Method 3 with
the gate off — exactly the build it came from, so archived exports still replay correctly, but a
green from one would have said nothing about this change. Also decoded: SL 0.886, TP rungs 0/0,
`cfg_exitmode = 20` (the ratchet), min-stop Off.
Earlier the same day: **the stop level is no longer limited to the five-value dropdown.**
`exec_sl_level = "Custom"` reads a new `exec_sl_custom` (any fib ratio in (0, 1.0], default 0.886),
priced off the leg anchors through the canonical `fib_level()` — so **Custom 0.886 is bit-identical
to picking "0.886"** and the mode switch alone moves nothing. It opens the half of the range the
ladder never had (0.886 → 1.0: deeper stop, smaller position) and, being a NUMBER, makes the level a
real optimizer axis instead of five strings. Out-of-range raises at construction rather than falling
back to fib 1.0, because a typed number silently becoming a different stop would replay a whole
backtest against a level nobody chose. ⚠ **No Pine counterpart** — `execSlLevel` is an `input.string`
with five options, so `compare_strategy.py` can never configure a Custom run (parity is therefore
structurally unaffected) and **a Custom result is a lab finding, not a validated one**. ⚠ Shallower
than 0.886 is Run 4's hazard at any ratio, not only at three — turn `exec_min_stop_mode` on first.
Detail: `### The Custom stop level`. 129 tests green (7 new).
Earlier: 2026-08-01 — 🔴 **THE FILL BAR WAS STAGING THE STOP — fixed, and it moved every
number in this file.** `indicators/BUG_exit_fill_price_mismatch.md`, open since 2026-07-14, was not
a TradingView artifact: `_advance_stage` ran on the ENTRY bar and read that bar's whole high/low.
A resting limit is reached by price coming to it from the wrong side, so the entry bar's
*favourable* extreme is the approach to the order, never the trade's own move — the stop went to
breakeven on a trade that had gone nowhere, which puts it on the WRONG SIDE of the market, and
every leg market-closed at the next bar's open. Fixed here (`step` skips `_advance_stage` when
`opened`, `step_secondary` likewise, `_max_fav` seeds from the fill price) and in all five strategy
Pine files. **The excursion pair is now seeded ASYMMETRICALLY and that is deliberate** — a buy
limit fills on the way DOWN, so the entry bar's LOW is post-fill and a real adverse excursion while
its HIGH is only the approach; seeding both flat threw real information away and
`test_trade_records_favorable_and_adverse_excursion` caught it. **Measured on lab run
`d2ab68f9e884`** (XAUUSD 15m, 2020-01-01 → 2026-07-31): **all 165 entries identical**, 30 results
changed (18 better / 12 worse), **+101.68R → +112.43R**, win rate 63.6% → 67.3%. Four trades the
bug had killed at breakeven were really +3.90R / +2.98R / +2.86R / +1.87R. ⚠ **12 trades that used
to scratch now take a full −1R and max drawdown was NOT measured** — re-run in the lab before
quoting any risk number. ✅ **PARITY RE-VALIDATED the same day** on a FULL-HISTORY post-fix export
(`VANTAGE_XAUUSD, 15_fd236.csv`, **21,691 bars**, 2025-08-31 → 2026-07-31): `compare_strategy.py`
**exit 0** at warmups 100 / 200 / 500 / 1000 / 2000, no truncation warning. **The fingerprint is
gone from the bars:** on the entry bar, is `px_stop` already at breakeven instead of the real SL?
Before = **4 of 26** entries; after = **0 of 27**. All four affected candles are inside the window,
so each reads before/after on the same bar — 2025-10-02 died in 1 bar at −0.120R and now runs **47
bars to +0.008R**; 2025-12-02 −0.860R → **−1.000R**; 2026-05-11 +0.008R → **−1.000R**; 2026-07-20
**unchanged** at +0.859R (wrong stop, never hit). Three of four get worse or stay flat; the fix is
right anyway, because the exit price now corresponds to an order the strategy actually placed. An
earlier PARTIAL export the same day exposed a harness asymmetry, now fixed: `compare_strategy.py`
HARD REFUSED a truncated export where `compare_bleg.py` replays until the engine converges. It now
warns and requires `--warmup >= the missing bars` (`--debug-arm` still refuses — it diffs the
chart-relative `dbg_*` bar indices). ⚠ **Every measured number below this line — 110.65R, Run 8's 43% → 53%
run-capture, all twelve runs in `mpc_sos_fade_optimization.md` — was taken THROUGH this bug and
needs re-baselining**; the exit-ladder conclusions are the most exposed, because the bug killed
trades one bar after entry, before the ladder ever engaged. 3 regression tests, 534 green.
**The lesson: a green `compare_strategy.py` says Pine and Python AGREE, never that either is
right** — this bug was faithfully ported, so the gate was green for its whole life. **Recorded the
same day and NOT part of the bug: a wrong-side stop can still fill at the next bar's open
legitimately, and it is a backtest limitation rather than a defect** — see
`### Wrong-side stop fills` before anyone re-reports the symptom.
Earlier: 2026-07-31 — 🔴 **THE BOT WAS RELYING ON AN ENGINE DEFAULT IT NEVER PINNED.** `engine_config()` pinned `fvg_max_count` and `fvg_require_close` but not **`fvg_threshold_pct`** — the minimum-gap floor, which decides which FVGs exist and therefore which entry edges exist at all. It was inheriting `backtest/replay/stack.py`'s `0.1`, which matches `mpc_strategy.pine`'s 15m floor **by coincidence, not by decision** (that shared default was flagged as "stale, harmless, every real consumer pins its own" — half of which was false). Proven load-bearing by removing it: `compare_strategy.py` failed on the FIRST compared bar. Now pinned explicitly, `stack.py` carries the engine default again, and the pin test asserts all four. **No number moves** — `compare_strategy.py --warmup 100` still exit 0 on the 2026-07-29 export, 529 tests green. See `## Engine-construction pins`. **The rule this sharpens:** *an engine input the decision stream does not export is a silent parity trap* already existed — what was missing is that it applies to an input a bot FORGOT to pin, not only to one whose default changed. Also this session: the session windows underneath this bot (`SessionEngine`, reached via `EngineStack`, feeding `recent_ssl`/`recent_bsl`) were re-synced to the mpc paste; this bot's Pine has had the new windows since 2026-07-12, so the Python had been running the OLD ones against it — parity stayed green through the change. Earlier: 2026-07-30 — **the MINIMUM-STOP GUARD is ported, closing the one known Pine↔Python
divergence on this pair.** `exec_min_stop_mode` / `exec_min_stop_val`, the floor applied at order
placement, block reason code 7, a REGENERATED `mpc_strategy_export.pine` (body byte-identical to the
parent again) carrying `cfg_min_stop` / `cfg_min_stop_val`, and the decode in `compare_strategy.py`.
Built as step 1 of the live-trading pipeline (`docs/LIVE_TRADING_PIPELINE.md`) because it is the
guard for the only hazard in this bot that can lose real money fast: a stop that collapses onto the
entry does not risk less, it balloons `qty = risk / dist`. **Default `"Off"`, byte-identical to the
previous build, so no historical result moves** — and equally, nothing here validates the filter ON
until a fresh export is diffed. Full record: `### The minimum-stop guard`. 111 tests green.
Earlier: 2026-07-29 — **Run 12: "can this bot trade more?" is answered NO, and one claim in
this file was measured wrong and is now corrected.** The `## The missed-setup watch` section used to
call the "No FVG in zone" bucket the layer's *actionable* output; replaying 6.5 years with
`exec_req_fvg` off shows those setups are a coin flip whose entire positive result is one 2020 trade
and whose sign flips with the counterfactual entry price — see the ⚠ block there. Three other routes
to more trades (smaller size on the extras, deeper entries, a looser gap rule) are negative too, and
the final-hour rule costs ~0.4R over 6.5 years so it stays on. **No strategy code changed**; the only
code change is a Pine UI cap (`aplusWindow` maxval 4320 → 20160, default still 4320, so no result
moves — `aplus_window` here never had a cap). Earlier the same day: **parity re-run GREEN on a fresh
export that finally carries the ratchet AND the shipped 0/0 rungs** (`### PARITY GREEN 2026-07-29`).
Every "the export is stale" warning in this file is cleared, with one exception that was NOT cleared
then and IS now: the export had no `execMinStopMode`/`execMinStopVal` column — see the 2026-07-30
entry above.
Earlier: 2026-07-27 — `exec_sl_level` defaulted **"1.0" → "0.886"** in lockstep with both
A+ Pine files (Aaron's call — it is what he trades, and Run 6 rode it over the full history). The
⚠ block below is AMENDED, not retracted: 0.886 is still inside the entry band and neither Run 4
defect is fixed; 0.618 / 0.702 / 0.786 stay unsupported. `mpc_bleg` PINS "1.0" rather than
inheriting, because its own Pine still ships 1.0. Earlier the same day: `Execution` now also
records MISSED SETUPS (the Pine's orange 2-of-3
callout, reporting-only) for the lab price chart's Missed layer; see `## The missed-setup watch`.
Earlier the same day: `exec_tp1_pct`/`exec_tp2_pct` defaulted 30/40 → **0/0** (Run 1
adopted; the whole position rides the runner), and **PARITY RE-VALIDATED GREEN (exit 0)** on a fresh
21,320-bar 15m export taken at the settings Aaron trades — SL fib 0.886, TP1 0%, TP2 0%, structure
trail. First run of the 0/0 exit path against the Pine. See `## The exit ladder`. Earlier the same
day: `Execution` now records BLOCKED SETUPS (the Pine's pink TRADE
BLOCKED tag, reporting-only) for the lab price chart's Blocked layer. Earlier: 2026-07-26 — the
exit levers (structure runner trail, TP2 stop floor, the three
setup toggles) ported from the Pine, the export's config columns completed, and **PARITY RE-VALIDATED
GREEN (exit 0)** on a fresh 21,230-bar `VANTAGE_XAUUSD, 15m` export — which caught a real unpinned-
engine-input bug (`fvg_require_close`). See `## The exit ladder` and `## The 2026-07-26 exit-lever sync`.

---

## The name (renamed 2026-07-16 — was `mpc_aplus` / `MpcAplusStrategy`)

`MPC` = Mental Peak Consulting (Aaron's brother's company) and prefixes every strategy in the
house. The suffix names the **narrative** the strategy trades off the shared `engines/` — here:
a **shift of structure (SOS)**, faded. The old name described the *grade filter* it happens to
use, not what it does, and "A+" would collide the moment a second MPC bot also traded A+ setups.

**"A+" is still correct vocabulary and is deliberately kept** wherever it names the brother's own
Pine concept — the A+/B/C/D grade dropdown, the "A+ SETUP SEQUENCE" block this ports, and the
`aplus_window` config field (which mirrors the Pine input "Max time: sweep → SOS (minutes)" and is
a lab param-grid key). Renaming those would break the line-for-line traceability to the Pine, and
`aplus_window` is also an optimizer grid key. The Pine files themselves are NEVER renamed: they are
the brother's source and the parity reference.

## Sizing — this bot sizes ITSELF

`LAB_STRATEGY` declares `self_sizing: True`, so the command-center lab does NOT run its dynamic
sizing engine over this bot's trades. `exec_risk_pct` (Pine default **10%** per trade) IS the risk
knob: it is a normal strategy param, so it is editable in the Run modal and sweepable in the
optimizer grid — that is the "manual %" for this strategy, and the SIZING MODE control is hidden
because there is nothing for it to decide. Pair a run with the **Unconstrained (No Limits)**
ruleset to see the raw behaviour with no halts and no drawdown floor cutting a day short.

**Input range (2026-07-27):** the Pine input's `maxval` was raised **10 → 100** across all four
strategy Pine files at Aaron's request — the old 10 was an arbitrary UI cap, not a safety rule, and
`exec_risk_pct` in `config.py` never had one. The DEFAULT is still 10 on both sides, so no run
changes. Two things the raised ceiling exposes and neither side checks: the `margin_long/short =
0.2` pin means TradingView rejects (or partially fills) an entry whose notional exceeds 5x equity —
silently, as a missing trade rather than an error — and the **no-minimum-stop-distance hazard**
below scales linearly with the risk %, so a degenerate stop that realised ~180% of equity at
`exec_risk_pct = 10` realises the same multiple of whatever is typed here.

## The portfolio-account seam (2026-07-17)

`Execution.__init__` takes an injected `account` (default `SoloAccount`) and a `leg` name — the seam
for stacking this bot with others on ONE shared account (`backtest/portfolio/`). What changed:
`self.equity` now reads `account.balance` (the shared balance the bot sizes against); the leg-local
`_equity_realized` is kept for R. The fill gate in `_open_position` calls `account.request_fill`,
which **scales** the bot's own desired qty to the shared room (solo → full size); partial exits and
costs `book_pnl` onto the shared balance; the full close frees the reservation; each bar reports the
live stop via `update_stop`. **Parity is unchanged:** a `SoloAccount` grants full size always, so
`compare_strategy.py` stays exit 0 — re-verified on the 20,076-bar export after the seam landed. The
account scales the bot's qty rather than recomputing it precisely so parity holds (the bot sizes off
the limit price at placement, not the fill). Do not route qty computation through the account.

## What it is (one paragraph)

A counter-trend reversal that fades exhaustion at HTF liquidity. Three-stage A+ sequence: **Arm**
(liquidity sweep by default, or an RSI divergence) → **SOS** (a same-side external structure break in
the trade direction, inside a staleness window) → **Zone+FVG** (price retraces into the 0.5–0.886 fib
band and a live FVG overlaps it; default requires the gap fully past 0.5). Entry is a resting limit — a
deep gap re-prices to the nearest shallower fib (Method 3), else the FVG's near edge, clamped into the
band; stop = fib 1.0 (leg origin) + buffer; exit = the fib TP ladder (30/40/runner) with stop→BE on
TP1, stop→TP1 on TP2, and a ratcheting trail on the runner. Full rules: `docs/MPC_SOS_FADE_SPEC.md`.

## The five modules (the data flow)

```
BarState  --SignalAdapter-->  Signals  --SosFadeSequence-->  SeqState  --Execution-->  Decision
(backtest.replay)             (Pine-named inputs)          (A+ stages)               (orders + fills + R)
```

- **`config.py`** — `SosFadeConfig`: every trade-affecting Pine input toggle, same name + default
  (**toggle parity is a hard requirement**). Instrument facts (mintick, point value, close time) are
  Layer-B injections, also here. Cosmetic Pine inputs (debug labels, boxes, table styling) are
  deliberately absent — they don't touch a trade decision.
- **`signals.py`** — `SignalAdapter`: turns a replay `BarState` into the exact Pine-named globals the
  A+ block reads. Two reconstructions are non-trivial and must stay faithful:
  1. `recentSSL` / `recentBSL` — the most-recent swept pool per side, from ten per-source slots
     (H4 / Day / Asia / London / NY high & low) resolved by latest sweep bar, sessions suppressed
     once Day is filled. Rebuilt from the liquidity engine's `mitigated` / `evicted` events.
  2. `bullDivActive` / `longVeto` — recomputed WITH the structure-break staleness (`lastExtBreakBar`)
     the standalone RSI engine can't see. **Do NOT use the RSI engine's convenience `bull_active`** —
     it omits the stale check and would diverge from the Pine.
- **`sequence.py`** — `SosFadeSequence`: the Stage 1→4 state machine, retro-link (a late-confirming
  divergence adopting an SOS that already fired), sequence death (opposite SOS / TP3 / invalidation /
  continuation BOS), and the arm-source snapshot (which Stage-1 source was live at the SOS).
- **`execution.py`** — `Execution`: entry edge → resting limit → TP1/TP2/runner ladder → staged stop
  + ratchet → %-risk sizing → graded R, on a small broker emulator (`_Broker`-style) that reproduces
  the two TradingView fill assumptions logic parity depends on:
  1. **calc-on-close, one-bar delay** — an order placed at a bar's close is active only next bar (a
     resting limit never fills the bar it was placed; an exit never fills the bar the entry filled).
     **This is also a KNOWN BACKTEST LIMITATION, not a defect — see `### Wrong-side stop fills`
     below before reporting it as one.**
  2. **intrabar path** — when a bar covers both a TP and the stop, the open's proximity to the
     extremes decides which fills first (open nearer high ⇒ price travels open→high→low→close ⇒
     targets first; nearer low ⇒ stop first). **This is the single most parity-sensitive assumption
     — it is a GUESS until `compare_strategy.py` is exit 0.**
  Each closed `Trade` also carries **reporting-only excursion** — `mfe_usd` (favorable: the most it
  ever showed in profit) and `mae_usd` (adverse: the deepest it sat against us), tracked across the
  whole hold on bar high/low (`_ext_high`/`_ext_low`) and converted to USD at close. NO decision
  reads them, so they are parity-safe (`compare_strategy.py` diffs the `px_*` decision stream, not
  `Trade`); they flow through `backtest/output.py` to the lab's equity-chart excursion overlay.
  `Execution` also records **blocked setups** (`BlockedSetup`, `execution.blocks`) — a port of the
  Pine's pink `TRADE BLOCKED` tag (`mpc_strategy.pine` 4025-4086): a setup price and the engine had
  READY (SOS in, fib agreeing, an entry edge to rest on, flat, this leg untraded) that one of the
  strategy's OWN toggles refused. Same six reason codes in the same PRECEDENCE (`f_blkCode`: 1
  direction off · 2 arm source off · 3 final hour · 4 divergence/extreme veto · 5 HTF breakout · 6
  HTF bias), the same hover text as `f_blkWhy`, and the Pine's `sosBar*10 + code` dedupe generalised
  to the reason SET — one record per setup per distinct COMBINATION, so a setup blocked for twenty
  bars is one record but a set that changes is a genuinely different refusal.
  **ONE DELIBERATE DEVIATION:** the Pine reports only the FIRST blocker (a chart tag has room for one
  line); we record EVERY rule refusing the setup, because the lab filters by reason and "blocked by
  the veto" has to stay true when the final hour was also blocking. Precedence survives as the ORDER,
  so `codes[0]` (exposed as `.code`) is exactly what `f_blkCode` would have returned alone — a
  per-reason count taken off the primary still reconciles with TradingView.
  **Reporting-only and parity-safe**, exactly like the excursion fields:
  nothing reads a record back, so no decision can move and `compare_strategy.py` diffs the same
  `px_*` stream as before. The recording hangs off `_place_entries` (reading gates `_armed`
  computed, never recomputing them), which is why `mpc_bleg` gets none — it overrides that method,
  and those codes describe why an *A+* setup was refused. Surfaced on the lab price chart's Blocked
  layer; the full path is in `command-center/backend/CLAUDE.md` → *Blocked setups*.
  `Execution` also records **missed setups** (`MissedSetup`, `execution.misses`) — the OTHER half of
  "why didn't this trade", and a port of the Pine's orange 2-of-3 callout (`f_w23Arm` / `f_w23`,
  `mpc_strategy.pine` 3064-3194 + 4022-4023). See *The missed-setup watch* below.
- **`strategy.py`** — `MpcSosFadeStrategy`: the driver. `run(df, warmup=…)` replays a canonical frame
  end-to-end; `step(bar_state)` does one bar. Collects `.decisions` (the per-bar stream) and
  `.execution.trades`.
- **`secondary.py`** — the 1m sniper re-entry (below). `Structure1m` (1m structure feed, port of Pine
  `f_struct1m`) + `SecondaryArm` (the latch/arm, port of Pine `f_secArm`). Consumed by `run_dual`.

## The missed-setup watch (2026-07-27) — the setups that died, not the ones that were refused

A **block** and a **miss** answer the same question one step apart in a setup's life, and mixing
them up makes both useless. A block is a trade the strategy had FULLY READY and one of its own
toggles refused. A miss never got that far: it reached 2 or 3 of the three confluences and then
DIED. Neither places an order, so neither is in any trade list, any equity curve, or any broker
report — the only place either is countable is here.

The three confluences, and what "met" means (Pine `f_w23`):

| # | Confluence | Met when |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **ARM** | a liquidity sweep or an RSI divergence armed Stage 1 — and the source that fired is one you have ENABLED |
| 2 | **SOS** | always: it is why the watch is open at all |
| 3 | **ZONE** | price tagged the 0.5-0.886 band AND (with Require-FVG on) a gap was live in it while price was there |

**Exactly one thing is ever missing**, which is why `MissedSetup` carries a single `code` where
`BlockedSetup` carries a list. At 2 of 3 it is the arm or the zone (codes 1-3); at 3 of 3 every
confluence was there and the entry still never happened, so the record names the ENTRY-side reason
instead, in the Pine's precedence: veto → final hour → HTF → "the limit rested and price never
touched it" (codes 4-7). `reasons` is still exposed as a one-item LIST purely so a miss and a block
read identically all the way downstream.

**Three deliberate deviations from the Pine, all reporting-side:**

1. **Every miss is recorded; nothing is filtered at write time.** The Pine has three view filters
   (`debugShow23`, `debug23Filter`, `debugShow23Disarmed`) plus a `debugDays` recency window because
   TradingView caps a chart at 500 labels. The lab has neither problem, and a miss filtered away at
   write time can never be counted later. The chart filters BY REASON instead, which is strictly
   more expressive than the Pine's three presets.
2. **`near` replaces those presets.** Each record carries the Pine's own near-miss test
   (`metN == 3 or (zone reached and zone not met)`). The chart derives its DEFAULT view from it —
   see `command-center/backend/CLAUDE.md` → *Missed setups* — so the layer opens on the Pine's
   default and one click widens it, which the Pine's radio buttons cannot do.
3. **A setup that filled this bar closes as TRADED immediately.** The Pine assigns `tradedSosL`
   further down its script than it reads it, so on the fill bar it still reads the previous value.
   Both end with no callout; ours gets there a bar sooner, and it is the correct answer on the one
   bar where they differ (a trade that opened and closed inside the same bar, which the Pine would
   have booked as a miss).

**Where it runs, and why not where the blocks run.** `_record_misses` is called from `step()`,
between the fills and the placement — the same slot the Pine calls `f_w23` from. It CANNOT hang off
`_place_entries` like the block recorder does: a setup keeps accumulating state while a position
from the other side is open, and that path never runs then. That is also why `_bar_gates` was
extracted from `_armed` (the final-hour / HTF / bias gates are needed on every bar, not only when
flat) and why `mpc_bleg` needs the explicit `_records_misses = False` opt-out rather than getting
the exclusion for free.

**Two additions this needed elsewhere, both parity-neutral.** `SeqState` gained `l_arm_src` /
`s_arm_src` (Pine `armHolderL`/`armHolderS`) — the source holding the Stage-1 slot, which is the one
thing the live `sos_*_swp`/`sos_*_div` flags cannot tell you once the execution layer has filtered
them through the toggles, and without it a "your arm source is off" reason could not say WHICH one.
`build_results` gained `missed_setups`.

**Measured on the shipped window** (XAUUSD M15, 2025-03-04 → 2026-07-27, 33,041 bars, defaults):
46 trades, 80 blocks, **93 misses** — 50 "No retrace" (none near), 35 "No FVG in zone" (all near),
4 "Never filled", 4 "Final hour". So the chart opens on 43 markers and the routine 50 are one click
away.

⚠ **"No FVG in zone" is a DIAGNOSTIC, not a to-do list — corrected 2026-07-29 (Run 12).** This
section used to call that bucket "the actionable number this whole layer exists to produce". It was
then measured over 6.5 years (2020-01-01 → 2026-07-29, 155,186 M15 bars) by replaying the same bars
with `exec_req_fvg` off, and **taking those setups is not worth it**: 180 no-FVG misses, 173 fill at
the 0.618 fallback, **50 win / 54 loss / 69 breakeven** (median +0.04R) for +34.0R gross — of which
**40% is one January-2020 trade**, and they crowd out 17 real trades worth +21.0R, so the net is
+13.0R on a 110.6R book while max drawdown goes **54.9% → 77.1%**. The sign also flips with the
counterfactual entry price (+13.0R at fib 0.618, **−6.7R at 0.5**), which is the signature of noise
rather than an edge. Deepening the entry and loosening which gaps qualify are both worse still.
**Read the layer as "why didn't this trade", never as "here is missed money"** — full record and the
three other routes in `mpc_sos_fade_optimization.md` → Run 12 / 12b.

## Secondary (1m sniper) re-entry — `exec_secondary` (built 2026-07-19, NOT committed)

The 1-minute re-entry Aaron prototyped in Pine, built as the *exact* version here (Pine can only
sample the 1m engine once per 15m bar — its own tooltip says "the exact version is the Python port").
**Full rules + design: `docs/MPC_SOS_FADE_SECONDARY.md`.** One paragraph: after the **primary** 15m
A+ trade on a leg has traded and gone flat, while the 15m div + SOS are still live and price is back
in the 0.618-0.886 zone, a **1m shift of structure** in the trade direction rests a limit at a 38.2%
retrace of that tight 1m leg (stop = 1m leg origin; TP1/TP2 = 15m 0.5/0.382; runner = TP3). One
re-entry per 1m leg; a re-entry is never the first trade on a leg.

- **`run_dual(df15, df1m)`** merges the two streams on a close-time clock: the **primary** is stepped
  on 15m bars exactly as `run(df15)` (so parity is untouched); the **secondary** latches/arms/fills/
  manages on real **1m** bars — the sniper "in and out fast" a 15m bar can't express.
- **Execution** grows an `_entry_kind` tag + `step_secondary(bar1m, arm)`. A 15m bar only ever
  touches a `primary` position; a 1m bar only a `secondary`. They share the one position slot but
  never the same trade (the secondary arms only when flat), so the tag is all that separates them.
  With `exec_secondary` OFF, no secondary ever opens, so `step()` is byte-identical to before.
- **NO Pine parity gate** — the Pine is only the approximate version, so this is verified **visually**
  (the lab price chart + the 15m→1m drill-down). The offline guard is
  `test_run_dual_primary_is_identical_to_run_when_secondary_off` + the hand-traced arm/exec tests in
  `tests/test_secondary.py`, and OFF parity was re-confirmed on the real M15/M1 cache (`run` ==
  `run_dual`, 40 trades byte-identical). `compare_strategy.py` (which runs `run`, not `run_dual`)
  stays the primary's gate.
- **Sparse-data note:** the secondary is rare (a live leg + zone + a 1m SOS + div, all at once). Over
  the ~4 days of local 1m cache it fired 0 times — expected, not a bug (see the arm trace). A real
  visual verification needs a longer 1m window (broker serves ~35d direct; older via ticks).

## The exit ladder — every TP/SL lever, and which ones are switchable

The register of how this bot (and `mpc_bleg`, which reuses the whole ladder) decides where the
stop and the targets sit. Keep it current: a new exit lever in the Pine lands here, in `config.py`,
in `mpc_strategy_export.pine`, and in `compare_strategy.py` in ONE commit.

| Stage | What sets it | Switchable? |
|---|---|---|
| **Stop loss** | A fib on the deep side of 0.5, `exec_sl_level` ∈ {0.618, 0.702, 0.786, **0.886**, 1.0, **Custom**}, then `exec_sl_buf_tk` ticks beyond it. **Default 0.886 since 2026-07-27** (the deep edge of the entry band, and what Aaron trades); 1.0 = the leg origin. **"Custom" (2026-08-02) reads `exec_sl_custom` instead** — any ratio in (0, 1.0]. | **0.886 → 1.0 only** (the dropdown values or any Custom ratio between them) — anything shallower is unsupported, see the warning below |
| **TP1 / TP2** | Fibs, chosen AUTOMATICALLY by how deep the entry was. Deep entry → TP1 = 0.5, TP2 = 0.382. Shallow → TP1 = 0.382, TP2 = 0.0 (the swing extreme). | **No** — only the sizes (`exec_tp1_pct` / `exec_tp2_pct`, **both default 0** since 2026-07-27: bank nothing, ride the runner) |
| **TP3 (the runner)** | No target at all. It rides a trailing stop, and it is where the strategy's money is (>100% of net in every window measured). | **Yes** — see below |
| **Stop staging** | Three phases, always on: (0) the full stop → (1) after TP1, breakeven + `exec_be_buf_tk` → (2) after TP2, a floor, then the trail. | **No** |
| **The TP2 floor** | `exec_tp2_stop_mode`: **"TP1 price"** (tight, can scratch the runner on the first pullback) / "Breakeven" (most room) / "One trail step behind" (never below breakeven). | **Yes** — dropdown |
| **The runner trail** | `exec_runner_trail`: "Fixed step" (a `exec_trail_step` grid ratchet anchored on TP2) / "Structure (swing)" (park the stop at the structure engine's last confirmed swing low/high, offset by `exec_struct_trail_buf_tk`) / **"Structure + % ratchet"** (same anchor, then climb one `exec_trail_pct`-of-price step per step of favourable move). | **Yes** — dropdown |
| **The ratchet step** | `exec_trail_pct`, default **1.0**. Only read in "Structure + % ratchet" mode. A PERCENT of price, never dollars — see below. | **Yes** |
| **Early bail-out** | `exec_close_opp_sos` (default OFF) force-closes on an opposite SOS instead of riding to the stop. **Measured INERT** (Run 5): turning it on produced a byte-identical trade list — an opposite SOS never fires before SL/TP has already resolved the position. There is nothing on the other end of this lever. | toggle exists, **does nothing** |
| **Deep-entry stop override** | `exec_sl_deep` (default **OFF**, Pine `execSlDeep`, 2026-08-02). An entry filling AT OR DEEPER THAN 0.786 puts its stop at the leg origin (1.0) instead of `exec_sl_level`; 0.702 and shallower keeps the chosen level. It exists because the entry band and the stop share the 0.886 line, so the band's deep end is priced against a stop it is nearly touching. ⚠ **It costs R on every trade it touches** — a 0.786 entry goes from a 0.100 stop to a 0.214 stop, so the runner falls 7.86R → 3.67R and the position is less than half the size. Measure it. | **Yes** — toggle |
| **Minimum stop distance** | `exec_min_stop_mode` ∈ {**"Off"**, "% of price", "Fixed $", "x ATR(14)"} + `exec_min_stop_val` (0.10). An ENTRY filter, not an exit lever — it lives in this table only because it is the guard for the `exec_sl_level` hazard two rows up. A setup whose stop lands closer to the entry than the floor places no order and records block code 7. | **Yes** — dropdown + floor; ported 2026-07-30 |

The floor and the trail compose: past TP2 the stop is the floor, and the trail may only tighten
it further, never loosen it. With Structure selected and no confirmed swing yet, the trail is
absent and the floor alone holds the stop.

**The TP rungs default to 0/0 (2026-07-27) — and 0 does NOT disable the target.** The rung SIZE and
the target PRICE are separate things. At 0 no size leaves at TP1/TP2, but `_advance_stage` still
watches those prices, so touching TP1 still stages the stop to breakeven and touching TP2 still
installs the floor and hands the runner to the trail. The whole position then exits as one runner leg.
This is the shipped behaviour because it is what Run 1 measured as best AND what Aaron actually trades.
`test_zero_pct_rungs_bank_nothing_but_still_stage_the_stop` locks both halves of that.
Python needs no special case (`_remaining_brackets` computes p1 = p2 = 0 and emits neither bracket);
**the Pine does** — `strategy.exit(qty_percent = 0)` closes the WHOLE position, so both Pine files skip
the call when the rung is 0. If you ever port a new rung, port that guard with it.

**`mpc_bleg` overrides TP1, TP2 and the SL** with its own band prices (SL = band origin, TP1 =
the broken swing extreme, TP2 = the expansion extreme). Everything from the staging down —
floor, trail, both dropdowns — is this table, inherited unchanged.

**Aaron's brother's tested best combo (the shipped default 2026-07-26):** Structure trail +
buffer 20 ticks + TP2 floor = TP1 price.

### The swing ratchet (`"Structure + % ratchet"`, DEFAULT since 2026-07-28)

**The problem it fixes.** The plain structure trail PARKS the stop at the last confirmed swing.
That swing is a LAGGING anchor: in a strong leg it ends up a long way behind, and the gap between
it and the high IS the runner's give-back. Measured over 6.6y / 164 trades (XAUUSD 15m, SL 0.886):
the strategy banked **27.5% of the total profit it ever showed open**, and on the 78 trades that
ran ≥$10 of gold it captured $2,283 of the $5,300 they moved — **57% handed back**.

**What it does.** Same anchor (`last_conf_swing ± exec_struct_trail_buf_tk`), but from there the
stop climbs one `exec_trail_pct`-of-price step for every step of favourable move. It falls back to
the bare anchor until the move is one full step past it, so it is **never LOOSER than the plain
structure trail — only equal or tighter** (`test_swing_ratchet_is_never_looser_than_the_plain_structure_trail`).

**Measured, vs the plain structure trail** (same 6.6y window, same 164 trades, same entries):

| | order-free edge | net | run actually banked | max DD |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Structure (swing) | 107.6R | $2.82M | **43%** | 54.7% |
| Structure + 1% ratchet | 109.3R | $3.81M | **53%** | 54.7% |

⚠ **Both rows were measured at `exec_tp1_pct = exec_tp2_pct = 1`, NOT at the shipped 0/0** (found
2026-07-28). The A/B is apples-to-apples so the comparison stands, but the absolute figures are not
the shipped configuration: at the true 0/0 default the same window gives **110.65R**, and the 1%+1%
rungs cost 1.4R. Quote 110.65R as "the current bot", not 109.3R — and run `compare_strategy.py` at
0/0 so the parity gate tests what the Pine actually ships.

**Read this honestly.** The EDGE is unchanged — +1.7R over 164 trades is noise, and 1.5% (106.3R)
/ 2.5% (110.4R) bounce either side of it, which is the signature of randomness rather than an
optimum. What is real is the 10-point jump in how much of each run survives to the close, and it
costs nothing: **percentage drawdown is IDENTICAL (54.7%, same day)** — the bigger DOLLAR drawdown
in an early write-up was a compounding-account artifact, not a risk increase. Only 11 exits change:
8 better (+13.2R), 3 worse (−11.5R), and ONE trade (2025-10-21, +25.23R → +16.27R) is nearly the
whole downside.

**Why PERCENT and not dollars.** Gold ran 1,500 → 3,400 across the test window, so no fixed $ step
is right at both ends ($20 is a 1.3% trail at 1,500 and 0.6% at 3,400). The dollar version tops out
at **100.4R vs the percent version's 109.3R** for exactly that reason, and it only ever climbs
toward the plain structure trail as the step widens — in dollars this dial cannot beat what it
replaced. Do not "simplify" it back to a $ step.

**Do NOT add a hard take-profit on top of it.** Tested (2026-07-28): a target is either too loose to
fire (40R was byte-identical to no target — no trade in 6.6y ever reached it) or tight enough to cut
the tail that IS the profit (15R → 86.4R, a fifth of the edge gone). The 25R row looks best on the
table and is three lucky trades — only 3 of 164 ever reached 25R peak. There is no useful middle.

**Extension fibs (NEGATIVE fibs past 0.0) — measured 2026-07-28, REJECTED in every form.** This is
the most natural-looking idea on the list and the one Aaron trades by hand, so it gets its own record
rather than a line in the list below. Past the 0.0 fib the runner has no target at all, so the
proposal was to bank at the standard extensions the way a discretionary trader would.

*As TAKE-PROFIT rungs, shallow* (0.0 / −0.272 / −0.414 / −0.618, all off at −0.618 — Aaron's hand
rule): **109.3R → 69.1R**, a third of the edge gone. Every one of 14 allocations lost, and the
ranking was perfectly monotonic in how much was banked — the limit of "bank less" is the shipped
runner. Best of them (50% at −0.618 only) still only reached 92.4R.

*As a STOP FLOOR* (bank nothing, but ratchet the stop up the extension ladder one rung behind price):
**worse than the targets — 109.3R → 56.1R at best**, roughly half the strategy. A fib level is a
FIXED price and does not breathe; the structure trail moves with the market and survives an ordinary
retrace, a horizontal line does not. The 23.5R trade became 10.5R, cut on a pullback six legs before
it actually finished. Same lesson as every other tightening experiment above.

*As DEEP rungs* (−1 / −2 / −3 / −4 / −6 — take nothing until the trade is already a monster, then
trim): far better than the shallow version and still not an improvement. Aaron's −1:10% / −4:50% /
−6:rest ladder = **106.3R**. The only rows that beat the baseline sit at −6, and **exactly ONE trade
in 6.6 years ever reached −6** (−6 take 100% = 112.2R, i.e. +1.55R over the true 110.65R baseline,
from a single 2020 trade). That is a description of July 2020, not a rule.

**The pattern, and why there is no ceiling to find.** Rule cost tracks how OFTEN the rule fires:
−1 touches 8 trades and costs 7–14R, −4 touches 2 and costs 1–3R, −6 touches 1 and costs nothing.
Every candidate converges on the baseline from below as it stops doing anything. There is no depth
at which banking becomes profitable — there is only a depth at which it becomes harmless.

**The shape of the book, which is the real reason.** Of 164 trades only **29 ever reach the 0.0 fib**,
11 reach −0.618, 8 reach −1, 2 reach −4, 1 reaches −6. Those **11 trades past −0.618 make 106R of the
109R total**. The two biggest ran to −4.77 and −6.74 and the trail paid −3.69 and −5.68. Any fixed
ceiling is applied to every trade, so it necessarily caps the handful that carry the strategy. Eight
trades DO run past 0.0 and hand the whole extension back (they exit at the 0.382 floor) — that leak
is real, but it is worth 5.7R and the cheapest rule that plugs it costs 17R.

**Four other exit ideas measured and REJECTED the same day, so they are not re-tried:** tightening
the trail in any form (fixed step $2–$40, chandelier 2–8×ATR, giveback caps 25–50%) costs 60–90% of
net; banking at the TP rungs (25/25, 33/33, 50/0) costs 60%; "stay loose then clamp once it is a
monster" (>3R/5R/8R/15R → a tight trail) costs 20–45%; and exiting on an opposing RSI divergence past
TP2 costs 77% — only 18 of 164 trades ever print one, the six biggest give-back trades print ZERO,
and where it does fire it fires 2–4 times so you can only ever act on the earliest and worst one.

**⚠ `exec_sl_level` — `"0.886"` (the default since 2026-07-27) and `"1.0"` only. Do NOT sweep or
ship 0.618 / 0.702 / 0.786** (Run 4, 2026-07-26). The entry is a resting limit inside the
**0.5–0.886 fib band**, and all four sub-1.0 levels sit inside that SAME band — so the stop can be
placed at, or past, the entry price. Nothing validates the result.

### The Custom stop level (`exec_sl_custom`, 2026-08-02)

Aaron's ask: *"let me enter a fib level as a stop loss outside of the predefined ones, as long as it
falls between 0 and 1 — 0.90 instead of 0.886."* The five-value dropdown had no answer, and a stop
is a PRICE, not a member of a set. `exec_sl_level = "Custom"` reads `exec_sl_custom` (a ratio in
(0, 1.0], default **0.886**) instead of a fiboP*.

**Where the price comes from.** `Signals` has carried `fibo_ash` / `fibo_asl` — the leg anchors the
fiboP* were built from — since `e2140c3`, with a comment naming this feature as the one consumer.
`_sl_anchor` feeds them to the canonical `engines.fibonacci.geometry.fib_level()`, the same helper
and the same IEEE-754 path the fib engine used, so **Custom 0.886 is bit-identical to picking
"0.886"** and switching the mode alone moves nothing. That equality is a test
(`test_custom_at_a_dropdown_value_is_the_SAME_price_to_the_last_bit`), on a bear leg too.

**Which half of the range this opens, and which half it must not.** 0.886 → 1.0 is the safe half and
the reason it exists: deeper stop, smaller position, more room before the setup is wrong — and it is
exactly the gap the ladder never covered. **Shallower than 0.886 walks straight back into Run 4's
hazard**, now reachable at any ratio rather than only at three: a stop shallower than the fill either
fails `dist > 0` (the order is cancelled, no trade and no tag) or leaves a tiny `dist`, and
`qty = risk / dist` balloons the position. Turn `exec_min_stop_mode` on first.

**An out-of-range ratio raises at construction, it does not fall back.** `SosFadeConfig.__post_init__`
refuses anything outside (0, 1.0] when — and only when — the mode reads it. The tempting alternative
was `_sl_anchor`'s existing shape (an unrecognised level falls through to fib 1.0), and that is the
wrong answer for a number a human typed: it would replay a whole backtest against a stop nobody
chose and report it as theirs. Validating only under `"Custom"` is deliberate too — the optimizer may
sweep `exec_sl_custom` behind a fixed mode, which is a wasted grid but not an error.

⚠ **NO PINE COUNTERPART, so a Custom run is unvalidated.** `mpc_strategy.pine`'s `execSlLevel` is an
`input.string` with five options; `compare_strategy.py` decodes `cfg_strcodes` into those five and
can therefore never configure a Custom run, which is also why parity is structurally unaffected by
this change. **A Custom result is a LAB finding, not a validated one** — port the input to the Pine
(a new `input.float` + a `cfg_` column + a `_SL_LEVEL` branch) before trading one. Note this is the
first lever in the exit ladder to be Python-first; every other one landed in the Pine first.

**In the lab:** the Stop level dropdown gains a "Custom" option and a numeric field appears under it
(`show_if`), the same pattern `exec_min_stop_mode` → `exec_min_stop_val` already uses. Because it is
a numeric field it is also a real **numeric optimizer axis** — sweep 0.88 → 1.00 step 0.01 and the
grid walks it, which a list of five strings never could.

**Why 0.886 is nonetheless the shipped default.** It is what Aaron trades, the 2026-07-27 parity
run went GREEN at it, and Run 6 rode it over the broker's whole intraday history (188 trades,
107.7R, 293x, −54.9% maxDD) with no degenerate stop. That is 0.886 being the SHALLOWEST point the
entry limit can itself rest at — the stop is just past the deep edge of the band, so the collapse
mode needs the entry to fill at almost exactly 0.886. **It is evidence of absence, not a
guarantee:** both defects below are still OPEN at this level, so treat a sudden outsized loss as
this hazard until proven otherwise, and turn the Pine's "Minimum stop distance" on for live use.

**The guard is now PORTED (2026-07-30) — it was the one known Pine↔Python divergence on the A+
pair, and it is closed.** `exec_min_stop_mode` / `exec_min_stop_val` in `config.py` (defaults `"Off"`
/ 0.10, matching the Pine), the floor applied at order placement in `_place_entries`, block reason
**code 7** ("Stop too tight") so a setup refused on PRICE is countable in the lab's Blocked layer
like every toggle refusal, and `cfg_min_stop` / `cfg_min_stop_val` columns in a regenerated
`mpc_strategy_export.pine` that `compare_strategy.py` decodes. See `### The minimum-stop guard`.

The four modes match the Pine exactly: `"Off"` (floor 0.0 — inert, so every historical result is
unmoved), `"% of price"` (self-scaling, the one Run 7 recommends at 0.10), `"Fixed $"`, and
`"x ATR(14)"` — the ATR being Pine's `ta.rma(ta.tr(true), 14)`, updated on every bar at the top of
`step()` rather than inside the entry branch, because a `ta.*` call that skips bars returns a
different number. **Turn it on for live trading**; leave it Off to reproduce a past run.

Measured consequence at `0.786` + 20 ticks
over full history: stop distance collapses to **$0.20** on 15m gold, `qty = risk / stop_distance`
builds a **39,033 oz (~$78M notional)** position, one bar takes **18× the intended risk**, and
equity ends at **−$63,726** — after which the bot stops trading entirely. Two defects behind it,
both still OPEN and both live-trading hazards:
1. No validation that the chosen SL fib is on the correct side of the entry, or a sane distance
   from it. Assume `mpc_strategy.pine` has the same exposure (same dropdown) until checked.
2. **No minimum stop distance.** `execution.py:329` sizes correctly —
   `qty = (equity * exec_risk_pct / 100) / dist` — so risk IS dynamic and a wider stop DOES give a
   smaller lot. The formula is not the bug. What it assumes is: `exec_risk_pct` is only the real
   risk **if the exit actually happens at the stop price**. That holds when the stop is wider than
   a typical bar (which `"1.0"` = leg origin always is) and fails completely when it is narrower —
   price gaps straight through and the realised loss is unbounded. At a $0.20 stop on 15m gold the
   nominal 10% risk was realised as **~180% in one bar**. So the guard needed is a floor on
   `dist` (e.g. ≥ some ATR multiple), NOT a change to the sizing math. A position/margin cap is
   worth adding as a second backstop, but it treats the symptom.

**This bot has no R:R dial.** Targets are fibs and the stop is a fib, so the risk-reward ratio is
an OUTPUT of leg geometry, never an input — no combination of existing parameters can express
"risk 1 to make 3". Answering that question needs an ATR-based stop distance + fixed-R targets,
which is new code here AND in the Pine. See Run 4's writeup for the two proposed routes.

**Every sweep of these levers is logged in `mpc_sos_fade_optimization.md`** — one entry per run,
with the full grid, per-year and per-half R, and whether it was adopted. Read it before tuning
anything here so a question already answered is not re-measured. **Twelve runs are recorded.** Only
1–7 are enumerated below (they are the exit-ladder work this section owns); 8–12 live in the log and
are summarised in the paragraph after the list. **Run 1 is ADOPTED (2026-07-27)** and **Run 8 is
SHIPPED (2026-07-28)**; every other run is measured and unadopted — Runs 1–3 on the same
185,530 M15 bars / 187 trades, Runs 6–7 on the full 185,668-bar history at 188 trades:

1. **TP split** (21 combos) — monotonic; best is `exec_tp1_pct=0, exec_tp2_pct=0` (100% on the
   runner) at 70.7R vs 47.9R for the shipped 30/40 split. **ADOPTED 2026-07-27 as the default**, in
   lockstep across `config.py` and both A+ Pine files. The tick-mode re-run this entry originally
   asked for was overtaken by better evidence: Aaron's own TradingView chart had been running the
   rungs at 1% each (the closest the input would take to 0) for the whole 2020-2026 Deep Backtest,
   so the setting has a real 162-trade out-of-sample record, not just a bar-mode sweep. Adopting it
   also FIXED a live hazard — see the `qty_percent = 0` guard note in `## The exit ladder`.
2. **The whole ladder** (525 combos) — re-confirms (1), and finds **both dropdowns are already at
   their best value**: structure trail beats every fixed step (best fixed = 62.5R), the trail
   buffer is nearly irrelevant (0.4R across 10→80 ticks), and `exec_tp2_stop_mode="One trail step
   behind"` is actively harmful (caps out at 42.3R). The TP split is the only lever with real
   variance: ~−2R per 10% moved off the runner.
3. **Stop TIMING** (35 combos, research-only dials — both moments are hardcoded in Python AND
   Pine) — **the shipped timing wins; nothing to adopt.** Delaying breakeven grows the average
   winner 3.7x (0.80R → 2.96R) but total R falls 25% and drawdown grows 3.5x, monotonically bad.
   **This settles the open question below about whether stop→BE on TP1 caps runners: it does not.**
   It converts full losses to scratches (avg loss −0.73R with it, −0.99R without) and that is worth
   more than the upside it forgoes. The biggest winner was +15.03R in all 35 combos — the trade
   that makes the money never traded against its stop, so this lever cannot reach it.
4. **Stop PLACEMENT** (40 combos) — **INVALID, discard the numbers.** Four of the five
   `exec_sl_level` values put the stop on top of the entry; equity ended at −$63,726. See the ⚠
   warning above — it is this run's writeup.
5. **"How do I cut the losers quicker?"** (2022+ cache, 118 trades) — **there is nothing to cut
   quicker with.** Both early-exit toggles measured at exactly zero effect (`exec_close_opp_sos`
   and `exec_htf_exhaust_only` each produced byte-identical trade lists), and a time stop would
   cut the WINNERS (all net comes from trades held past 20 bars). The diagnosis is the value:
   **every loss is a trade that never touched TP1**, and TP1 sits ~0.45R away while the stop sits
   1R away, so a losing trade dies a median 0.34R short of the level that would have staged it to
   breakeven. That makes this a stop-DISTANCE problem, not a stop-timing one. Re-running
   `exec_sl_level` on a clean window scored **59.3R at 0.786 vs 33.6R shipped at the same
   drawdown** — but 8 of its 108 trades reproduced Run 4's sub-$2-stop hazard, so it stays
   unadoptable. ~~The minimum-stop-distance guard is worth a measured ~+26R.~~ **That ~+26R figure
   is WRONG — superseded by Run 7**, which replayed the guard properly instead of filtering rows out
   of a finished trade list.
6. **"Cut trades early / block the losing pattern"** (2026-07-27; 8 years, per-bar R paths, ~40 cut
   variants + 10 entry blocks) — **the question is CLOSED, do not build it.** No loser runs straight
   to its stop (min MFE **+0.09R**, median +0.51R) and winners sit underwater just as deep (median
   MAE −0.36R), so the two populations are indistinguishable while the trade is live. Every cut
   family loses money. The −54.9% drawdown is a **losing streak at 10% risk**, not give-back —
   **risk % is the only lever that moves it.**
7. **The minimum-stop guard, measured properly** (2026-07-27; 17 real replays, three independent
   definitions: fixed $, % of price, ×ATR) — **it PASSES, at a MILD threshold only, as a SAFETY
   rule.** All three definitions agree: light (blocks 3–6 of 188 trades) = **+0.7 to +2.7R**;
   medium/heavy = **−12 to −39R**. Best is **`pct 0.1`** — the stop must be ≥ 0.1% of price
   (self-scaling, one line in Pine): 182 trades, **+2.5R**, blocks the −1.98R trade, and leaves
   2021/2024/2025/2026 **byte-identical**. Two cautions: the +2.5R is **noise-level** (ship it to
   close the hazard, not for the money — read sumR, never the ragged x-multiple), and it does
   **NOT** fix drawdown (−54.9% → −54.3%). **Not adopted — awaiting Aaron's go.** The follow-up it
   unblocks: re-run Run 5's `exec_sl_level` sweep with the guard installed, to see whether 0.786
   becomes adoptable.

**Runs 8–12, in one line each** (full write-ups in the log; do not re-measure any of them):
**8** the runner-exit space — **SHIPPED**, `"Structure + % ratchet"` at 1.0%, run-capture 43% → 53%
on the same 164 trades at identical % drawdown; every tightening family lost 60–90%. · **9** banking
at the extension fibs — **REJECTED in every form** (109.3R → 69.1R as rungs, 56.1R as a stop floor,
106.3R as deep rungs); 11 trades past −0.618 carry 106R of the 109R, so any fixed ceiling caps
exactly what pays. · **10** cutting by the SHAPE of the path — in/out-of-profit is **not** a loss
signal (32% base rate), the 0.886 fib cut fires zero times and 0.786 costs −27.0R; only a "no +0.15R
by bar 3 → close" stall cut is mildly positive (+4.8R) and it does not move drawdown. · **11** the
`exec_sl_level` sweep re-run WITH Run 7's guard — **`exec_sl_level` is settled at "0.886"**; 0.786 is
105.2R unguarded / 49.0R guarded, and 0.702/0.618 detonate. The one improvement is `0.886 + pct 0.1`
(112.0R, maxDD 54.3%, worst trade −1.98R → −1.00R), which independently confirms Run 7. · **12** *can
this strategy trade MORE?* — **no, not from inside the entry rule.** Dropping the FVG requirement,
sizing those extras smaller, deepening the entry and loosening which gaps qualify are all negative
or noise (see the ⚠ block in `## The missed-setup watch`), and the final-hour rule costs ~0.4R over
6.5 years so it stays on. **Trade count is a PORTFOLIO property here** — with one position slot every
marginal setup displaces a real one, and sizing UP trades already trusted beats adding new ones
(shipped book at `exec_risk_pct=12.5` = 832x @ 64.2% DD vs 426x @ 64.9% for the loosened book).

### Bar-mode costs — commission and slippage, charged at last (2026-08-01)

Bar mode charging ZERO costs is the parity requirement (deviation 3 above). Bar mode being
*incapable* of charging any is not, and the two were confused: the command-center lab collected
`commission_per_side` and `slippage_ticks` on every run, stored them, displayed them, and
`python_runner` read neither — so every lab run of this bot was frictionless while reporting a
cost profile it had not applied. The tell was 52 of one run's 54 losers each losing **exactly
10.00%** of prior equity.

`MpcSosFadeStrategy(..., cost_profile=<AccountProfile>)` now passes a profile straight through to
`Execution` in bar mode. **Omit it and every path is byte-identical to what it was**, which is
what keeps `compare_strategy.py` a valid gate — and the harness never passes one, so parity is
untouched by construction. `mpc_bleg` inherits the kwarg.

Two units, both deliberate, and both would look plausible if wrong:

- **Commission is per LOT per side** — a lot being 100 oz. Charged on the entry and on every
  ladder rung, through the existing `_charge_commission`, which means it lands inside the trade's
  own P&L and R rather than beside them.
- **Slippage is charged on MARKET exits only** (`_charge_slippage`, `_exit_portion(market=...)`).
  A stop is a market order and pays; the entry limit and the TP rungs are RESTING LIMITS, which
  fill at their price or better or not at all, so charging them would price a cost that does not
  exist. It is also skipped entirely in **tick mode**, where the fill price already contains the
  real slippage off the tape — charging an estimate on top would book it twice.

⚠ ~~**Swap is NOT charged from the lab's fields.**~~ **Closed 2026-08-02 — see below.**

### Layered costs — spread and swap, and the one that moves trades (2026-08-02)

Aaron's ask: *"you know the spread… the only thing we don't know is slippage."* Correct, and bar
mode was pricing neither the spread nor the swap. Both are now chargeable, from a broker profile
rather than a typed number, behind independent switches that are **all OFF by default** — the
baseline run stays frictionless so it stays comparable to the TradingView Strategy Tester, and
every cost is something you deliberately turned on. Lab contract: `python_runner.COST_LAYERS`.

**Swap needed almost nothing** — `_charge_swap` has run on every bar in bar mode since A2 and was
dead only because the lab passed `swap=None`. It matters here more than on most strategies: this
runner is designed to hold overnight (deviation 1) and gold swap is **−74.84 points/lot/night**
long on the Vantage demo.

**The spread is measured, and the number this repo had was the wrong broker's.** `$0.33` is PU
Prime's (688k ticks). Vantage — the broker every backtest here replays — measures **$0.22**
(median, over 1,494,459 cached ticks spanning 2025-08 → 2026-07; p90 0.27, p99 0.31). Using 0.33
would have overstated every backtest cost by 50%.

**MEASURED over 155,431 M15 bars, 2020-01-01 → 2026-07-31, at the shipped defaults:**

| run | trades | sum R | final equity | charged |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| free (the shipped baseline) | 161 | 135.94R | $28.26M | $0 |
| + spread as a cost | 161 | 130.27R | $16.27M | −$266,948 |
| + spread + swap | 161 | 123.90R | $10.09M | −$333,110 |
| **bid/ask fills + swap** | **159** | **141.93R** | **$29.48M** | −$361,835 |

Two things to take from that table, and the second is the one worth remembering.

⚠ **A small charge is not a small effect.** 12.04R of cost turns $28.3M into $10.1M — **64% of the
final balance for 9% of the R** — because at a fixed % risk a dollar not earned early never
compounds. Always read a cost against the R, never against the net dollars.

⚠ **The last row is HIGHER than the free baseline, and that is not a bug — it is what a
limit-entry strategy does with a spread.** A flat spread charge is the market-order intuition (buy
the ask, sell the bid, lose the spread), and nothing here is a market order: every entry and exit
names a PRICE, so the spread changes WHEN an order fills rather than what it fills at. On a long
the buy limit fills at its own price and the stop sells at its own price — identical cash result,
the limit is simply harder to reach. The cost lands almost entirely on SHORTS, which sell the bid
to get in and buy the ask to get out, so their stops arrive a spread early and their targets a
spread late. On this book that traded 6 marginal entries away and, because there is one position
slot, let 4 different setups through in their place — the queue effect Run 12 already measured.
**So read the flat charge as a conservative UPPER BOUND and `bid_ask_fills` as the real question.**
⚠ It is also the newest and least-validated path here: it is unit-tested per order side and
measured once. Treat a `bid_ask_fills` result as a lab finding until it has been read on a chart.

Everything else is unchanged and deliberately so: **omit the profile and every path is
byte-identical** (the free row above reproduces the documented 161 / +135.94R exactly), the
harness never passes one, and `compare_strategy.py` is still **exit 0**.

### Wrong-side stop fills — a KNOWN BACKTEST LIMITATION, not a bug (recorded 2026-08-01)

**Read this before reporting "the exit price matches no stop and no target" again.** That symptom
was the phantom-exit bug (`indicators/BUG_exit_fill_price_mismatch.md`, fixed 2026-08-01), but with
that fixed there is a *legitimate* residue that produces a similar-looking exit, and it will keep
appearing on the chart forever.

**The shape.** Price runs up, tags TP1, the ladder stages the stop to breakeven — and then price
closes back through breakeven **inside the same bar**. The stop only becomes live on the NEXT bar
(assumption 1 above, `calc_on_every_tick = false` / `process_orders_on_close = false`). By then it
is already behind the market, so the emulator converts it to a market order and fills at that bar's
**open**, not at the stop price.

**Why it is not a defect.** Being OUT is correct — price genuinely went through the stop. What is
imprecise is the exit PRICE, and only because a bar-replay backtest looks at orders once per bar
while a real broker watches every tick and would have filled at or near the stop. Three consequences
worth holding onto:

- It makes the backtest look **slightly worse than reality**, which is the safe direction to be
  wrong. Do not "fix" it to make numbers look better.
- **Pine and Python behave identically**, so **parity is unaffected** — `compare_strategy.py` and
  `compare_bleg.py` stay valid, and neither will ever flag it.
- It is a **bar-mode** property. `fill_model="tick"` resolves the stop against real ticks and will
  legitimately disagree here; that is the improvement, not drift (see `backtest/CLAUDE.md` → A2).

**Deliberately NOT fixed: a "a stop may never be placed through the market" clamp.** It would have
caught the phantom-exit bug on day one, but applied now it would change real trade behaviour and
would have to land in all five Pine files too. That makes it its own change with its own
measurement, not a tidy-up. ⚠ It also matters for **live**: the bridge places the stop with the
broker, so a live fill will land nearer the stop than the backtest's. Expect live to beat the
backtest marginally on exactly these trades — and treat any BIGGER live/backtest gap as a real
problem, not as this.

## The 2026-07-26 exit-lever sync

`mpc_strategy.pine` gained a structure-based runner trail, a TP2 stop-floor dropdown, an SL fib
dropdown and three setup toggles. Ported here, with the Pine's defaults adopted verbatim:

- **New config fields** — `exec_runner_trail` (**"Structure (swing)"**), `exec_struct_trail_buf_tk`
  (20), `exec_tp2_stop_mode` ("TP1 price"), `exec_aplus` (True), `exec_bleg` (False here, True in
  `BLegConfig`), `exec_fvg_50` (False). `exec_sl_level` already existed.
- **`signals.py`** — `Signals` gained `last_conf_high` / `last_conf_low`, passed straight through
  from the structure snapshot. Only `_advance_stage` reads them, and only past TP2.
- **`execution.py`** — `_trail()` gained the structure branch; the stage-2 floor moved out of
  `_current_stop()` into `_stage2_floor()`. Both anchors are snapshotted at the bar's CLOSE, the
  same one-bar delay `_max_fav` already had, because the stop placed at bar N's close is what bar
  N+1 trades against. Reading the live swing instead would silently make the trail clairvoyant.
- **`exec_fvg_50` is NOT ported** (same standing as `exec_conf_sz`) — `compare_strategy.py` refuses
  an export taken with it on. `exec_bleg` on is refused too: those trades belong to `mpc_bleg`.

### PARITY GREEN 2026-07-29 (exit 0) — the ratchet build, at the shipped rungs

`compare_strategy.py "VANTAGE_XAUUSD, 15_7b2f3.csv" --warmup 100` → **exit 0**. 21,494 bars,
2025-08-31 → 2026-07-29. Green at warmup 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 too.

This clears the 2026-07-28 stale warning. Two things make it the run that was actually needed:

1. **It carries the ratchet through the export.** `cfg_exitmode = 20` — the tens digit is the trail
   method, and it went 2-way → 3-way when `"Structure + % ratchet"` landed. Plus `cfg_trail_pct = 1`.
   An export taken before that change would decode the ratchet as the plain structure trail and go
   green while silently comparing two different exit ladders.
2. **It was taken at `cfg_tp1_pct = cfg_tp2_pct = 0`** — what the bot actually ships. The previous
   green run and the 109.3R ratchet headline were both at 1%/1%, which is not the shipped config.

26 trades graded, **sum 30.29R** over the ~11 months. Note this is the TradingView window, not the
6.6-year MT5 window the 110.65R baseline and the extension-fib work were measured on — the two
numbers are not comparable and neither supersedes the other.

⚠ **Not covered by this run:** it was taken before the minimum-stop guard was ported, at the `"Off"`
default where the gate is inert. It therefore still describes the CURRENT build exactly (see below —
Off is byte-identical on both sides), but it says nothing about the filter itself.

### The minimum-stop guard (ported 2026-07-30) — and what is NOT yet proven

The parent Pine had `execMinStopMode` / `execMinStopVal` and the Python did not. That was the one
known Pine↔Python divergence on this pair, and it was the dangerous kind: the export carried no
column for it, so `compare_strategy.py` would have gone GREEN while the Pine refused setups the
Python took. Closed in one pass:

| where | what changed |
|---|---|
| `config.py` | `exec_min_stop_mode` (default `"Off"`) + `exec_min_stop_val` (0.10) |
| `execution.py` | `_update_atr` (Pine `ta.atr(14)`), `_min_stop_floor`, `_stop_clears_floor` / `_stop_is_tight`; the floor gates both `_pend_long` and `_pend_short`; block reason **code 7** |
| `mpc_strategy_export.pine` | REGENERATED off the parent (body now byte-identical again apart from line 29's title) + `cfg_min_stop` / `cfg_min_stop_val` plots |
| `compare_strategy.py` | `_MIN_STOP` decode; **absent column ⇒ `"Off"`**, never the Python default |
| `mpc_sos_fade.meta.json` | both fields, with `show_if` on the mode (which needed `show_if` to accept a LIST of values — one enum, three ON states) |
| `mpc_bleg/config.py` | `exec_min_stop_mode` PINNED `"Off"` — that fork overrides `_place_entries`, so the floor never runs there and its Pine has no such input |

**At `"Off"` the two sides are byte-identical to what they were**, which is why the 2026-07-29 green
above still describes this build: the floor is 0.0, so `dist > 0 and dist >= 0.0` is the old
`dist > 0`, and code 7 cannot fire. 11 new tests pin that, both floor definitions, the ATR against
Wilder by hand, the precedence of code 7 behind a toggle refusal, and the decode.

⚠ **NOT yet proven: the filter ON, against a real export.** Everything above is unit-tested and
round-tripped through a synthetic export, which proves the two halves of OUR code agree — never that
they agree with TradingView (that is exactly the limit the B-LEG harness bug demonstrated). Before
trusting a run made with the guard on: re-paste `mpc_strategy_export.pine`, export at the mode you
intend to use, and re-run `compare_strategy.py` to exit 0.

### PARITY GREEN 2026-07-26 (exit 0) — and the bug the run caught

`compare_strategy.py "VANTAGE_XAUUSD, 15_e8beb.csv" --warmup 100` → **exit 0**, bar-for-bar identical
on 21,130 of 21,230 bars (20,730 15m bars, 2025-09-01 → 2026-07-25). The export starts mid-history, so
the ~100-bar warmup is genuine engine cold start, not a mask: every warmup from 100 up is green and the
first mismatch at warmup 0 is bar 16.

The first run came back with ONE mismatch, and it was a real bug, not noise:

> `bar 20315 2026-07-12 23:00:00 px_edge: py=4100.94376 pine=None`

Python computed a short entry edge on a bar where the Pine had none. The fib matched to the decimal
(`dbg_fib_p2`/`p6`/`ash`/`asl` all identical), so it was an **FVG lifetime** difference: Python held a
bearish gap created on the first bar after the weekend gap that the Pine never created at all.

**Root cause — an unpinned engine input.** `mpc_strategy.pine` HARDCODES the middle-bar close-cleared
check in its FVG detection (`close[1] > high[2]` / `close[1] < low[2]`, lines 1686/1688). The
`fair_value_gaps` engine has that as the OPTIONAL `require_close` flag, defaulting **False** (it mirrors
`mpc_assistant.pine`, where it IS an input and IS off). Nothing exported it, so nothing caught it — the
engine happily created gaps whose middle candle never cleared the void.

Fixed by making it explicit rather than implicit: `EngineConfig` gained `fvg_require_close` (default
False, so no other consumer moves) and `MpcSosFadeStrategy.engine_config()` pins it **True**, alongside
the `fvg_max_count=7` and `show_internal=False` pins that were already there for exactly this reason.
`test_engine_config_pins_every_input_the_pine_moved_off_its_default` locks all three.

**The lesson is the class of bug, not the flag.** An engine input the decision stream does not export
is invisible to the parity check until a fresh export happens to disagree — and this one had been wrong
since the FVG engine made the gate optional on 2026-07-18. Any time an engine's default changes, check
every `engine_config()` that replays a Pine which does NOT share that default.

**What the new export columns immediately paid for:** they revealed the Pine was running
`execTp1Pct = 20` / `execTp2Pct = 20`, not the 30/40 defaults. Before this change no column carried
them, so the bot would have silently replayed 30/40 against a 20/20 Pine and the diff would have been
blamed on logic.

**The export had a real hole while this was in flight.** `execRunnerTrail` defaulted to Structure in
the Pine on 2026-07-25, but no `cfg_*` column carried it, so `compare_strategy.py` configured the
bot to the fixed-step fallback and diffed two different strategies. Any parity result from that
window is drift, not a bug. `mpc_strategy_export.pine` now carries `cfg_bits` bits 16384 /
32768 / 65536 (`execAplus` / `execBLeg` / `execFvg50`), `cfg_exitmode` (both exit dropdowns), and
one raw column each for the six exit numerics + the scratch band. An export WITHOUT `cfg_exitmode`
is pre-2026-07-26 and `compare_strategy.py` prints a loud warning rather than guessing.

## Deliberate deviations from the Pine (per the framework)

All OFF for the parity check (to match the Pine); each is a real-run choice:
1. **Flat-by-close** — force-flat + no new entries N minutes before the daily close (`flat_by_close`).
   **Default False, and measured 2026-07-16: leave it that way.** A/B over 6.5 months: OFF $39,454 /
   PF 1.444 vs ON $19,813 / PF 1.253 on the same 32 trades. Only 4 trades ever held overnight, they
   were all winners, and they made 70% of the profit; total swap for the period was −$36.80. Flatting
   early buys a smaller drawdown for half the profit. (This param was DEAD CODE until 2026-07-16 —
   `_in_flat_window` read only `sig.ny_hour`, so "minutes left" was always a multiple of 60 and never
   hit the ≤15 window. Any A/B run before that date compared a flag against itself.)
2. ~~**Sizing** — real runs swap in the dynamic sizing engine under a ruleset.~~ **No longer true
   as of 2026-07-16:** the bot declares `self_sizing: True`, so real runs keep the Pine's own fixed-%
   sizing (`exec_risk_pct`) and the engine never re-sizes them — this is NOT a deviation any more,
   parity and real runs size identically. See `## Sizing — this bot sizes ITSELF` above.
3. **Fill model** — parity REQUIRES `fill_model="bar"` (the Pine's own intrabar guess, zero costs).
   Real runs set `fill_model="tick"` + `account_profile` + `symbol` for real bid/ask fills and costs.
   See `backtest/CLAUDE.md` A2 — tick mode disagreeing with the Pine is correct, not drift.

## Engine-construction pins (`MpcSosFadeStrategy.engine_config`)

**FOUR** engine inputs are NOT in the decision stream, so the bot pins them to the Pine STRATEGY's own
input defaults rather than the shared engine defaults — miss any one and the fib the bot reads drifts.
`test_engine_config_pins_every_input_the_pine_moved_off_its_default` asserts all four.
1. **`fvg_max_count=7`** — `mpc_strategy.pine` sets Max Active FVGs to 7 (the FVG engine default is 8);
   a smaller cap evicts the oldest gap one bar sooner and drops an entry edge Pine still holds.
2. **`fvg_threshold_pct=0.1`** *(added 2026-07-31 — it had NEVER been pinned)*. The minimum-gap floor.
   `mpc_strategy.pine` splits it by timeframe (`fvgThreshLTF` 0.0 below 15m / `fvgThreshHTF` **0.1** at
   15m and up, lines 116-118) and this bot trades 15m. `mpc_assistant.pine` uses **0.04** at 15m and
   the ENGINE default mirrors the indicator, so the two Pines genuinely disagree and no shared default
   can be right for both. **The bot worked for months by coincidence**: `backtest/replay/stack.py`
   happened to carry 0.1 as its own default. That default was itself stale relative to the engine, so
   anyone reconciling it would have silently moved this bot's trades with no test failing. Proven
   load-bearing by removing it — `compare_strategy.py` failed on the first compared bar
   (`px_edge` py=3478.99 vs pine=3475.43). `stack.py` now carries the engine default (0.0) and this
   pin carries the strategy's, which is the right way round.
3. **`fvg_require_close=True`** — `mpc_strategy.pine` HARDCODES the middle-bar close-cleared check
   while the engine defaults it OFF (mirroring the indicator). Caught 2026-07-26 as the single
   mismatch on a fresh export; full story in `### PARITY GREEN 2026-07-26`.
4. **`show_internal=False`** — the Pine's "Show Internal Structure" input defaults OFF, and Pine gates
   the ENTIRE internal block behind it (`internalActive = showInternal`), so `i_confirmed_*` is never
   set and the **Structure fib never adopts a more-extreme internal swing** as its anchor. The
   `market_structure` engine ALWAYS computes internal structure, so the `EngineStack` must be told to
   suppress the internal-derived snapshot fields (it blanks `i_confirmed_*` + `ifib_seed_*` when this
   is off). This is a real "a drawing toggle changes trade logic" coupling in the Pine — do not drop it.

## The three parity fixes (2026-07-16) — read before touching signals/fib

The port went green after fixing three faithful-translation gaps; each is a class of bug to watch for:
1. **Internal-swing adoption** (the `show_internal` pin above) — the engine's always-on internal
   structure fed the fib an anchor the Pine strategy never had (internal display off).
2. **Sweep double-count at the daily/session rollover** — Pine records a sweep on `d_lMit and not
   d_lMit[1]` (a bar-to-bar edge of a persistent VARIABLE). When a daily/session/H4 level rolls at
   18:00 and is re-taken on its own creation bar, `d_lMit[1]` (the old level, already swept) is still
   true, so no edge fires. The engine models levels (create / mitigate / EVICT) and the naive
   reconstruction latched on every `mitigated` event, re-recording the rollover sweep — which made a
   stale sweep look fresh and armed a trade Pine didn't. `signals.py` now reconstructs the Pine
   variable: reset on `created`, set on `mitigated`, **left alone on `evicted`**, edge vs the prior bar.
3. **The forming last bar** — TradingView exports the final (still-forming) bar's plotted series as
   NaN. `compare_strategy.py` now marks that bar `_px_present=False` and skips it, instead of reading
   `fillna(0)` as a real "stage 0" and flagging a phantom mismatch.

## The parity gate — `tools/compare_strategy.py` + `/audit-strategy`

The standing regression harness (same pattern as the engines' `compare_*.py`). `mpc_strategy_export.pine`
(in `indicators/`) = `mpc_strategy.pine` + an appended block that plots the per-bar decision stream
(`px_*`) and every toggle (`cfg_*`). Export it to CSV on a 5m XAUUSD chart; `compare_strategy.py` reads
the toggles, configures the bot identically, replays the same bars, and diffs the decision stream. Exit
0 = bar-for-bar identical. On a mismatch it names the first diverging bar + field. Run it via
`/audit-strategy`, or:
```
command-center/backend/.venv/bin/python strategies/python/mpc_sos_fade/tools/compare_strategy.py <export.csv> --warmup N
```

### The 2026-07-22 re-sync (the export was 7 days stale)

`mpc_strategy_export.pine` was last regenerated 2026-07-15 and had drifted on three trade-affecting
Pine changes, so any diff it produced was July-15 drift, not a bug. Regenerated from
`mpc_strategy.pine` @ `361f007`:

1. **The veto is now SOS-aware** (Pine `longVetoA`/`shortVetoA`, ~3701). A divergence printing AFTER
   the SOS no longer vetoes its own setup — once stage 2 is live the setup is waiting on a retrace,
   and an opposing divergence formed during that retrace IS the pullback. Only one already live at
   or before the SOS bar still blocks. Extreme RSI keeps blocking LIVE. **Ported here**: the veto
   moved out of `SignalAdapter.update()` (which has no sequence state) into `signals.sos_aware_veto()`,
   which `execution.py` and `secondary.py` both call. `Signals` now carries the veto PARTS
   (`veto_on`, `veto_rsi_ob`, `veto_rsi_os`) instead of the finished `long_veto`/`short_veto`.
   The old, stricter rule is why a lab run can miss a long TradingView took.
2. **`execConfSZ`** — "Allow Sniper Zone as entry confirmation", a second accepted entry
   confirmation alongside the FVG. **NOT ported.** `config.exec_conf_sz` exists (default False) and
   the export packs it as `cfg_bits` bit 4096, so `compare_strategy.py` REFUSES an export taken with
   it on rather than diffing against logic this bot lacks. Port = read `BarState.sniper`'s
   0.5-0.618 pocket as an entry edge on any leg with no qualifying FVG.
3. **CONT trades removed** from the Pine — the export used to carry `contL_ok`/`contS_ok`.
4. **`execDeepFib`** (Method 3, added 2026-07-23) — "Floating gap → nearest fib shallower" (titled
   "Entry: deep gap enters on nearest fib (not gap edge)" until the 2026-08-02 label sync).
   A qualifying FVG whose NEAR edge (long = gap top, short = gap bottom) sits deeper than
   0.618 rests its limit at the nearest fib just SHALLOWER (0.618/0.702/0.786) — the level price
   reaches first — instead of chasing a gap edge price may never tap. **PORTED here**: `config.exec_deep_fib`
   (default **True** as of 2026-07-23 — see the prime-combo defaults note below), `execution._deep_fib_edge()`
   + the override in `_entry_edges()`, the export packs it as `cfg_bits` bit 8192, and `compare_strategy.py`
   reads it (no refusal — it is fully ported). ONLY the near edge's position decides it; what the gap body
   crosses is irrelevant (an earlier "body contains a level" gate was WRONG and dropped exactly the deep
   multi-level gaps this targets).

**Prime-combo defaults (2026-07-23).** Aaron's TradingView-tested "prime" settings are now the shipped
defaults in BOTH Pine files and `config.py`, in lockstep so `compare_strategy.py` parity holds:
`exec_arm_sweep` False→**True**, `exec_arm_div` True→**False** (arm on liquidity sweeps, not divergence),
`exec_fvg_deep_only` False→**True**, `exec_deep_fib` (new) → **True**. `exec_req_fvg` stays True. Combo
result on Aaron's Strategy Tester: ≈+237% / PF 6.2 / 85% win / 13% max DD over ~2yr gold at 84 trades.
This SUPERSEDES the old divergence-armed default — the "2-year run" analysis further down was measured
under that old default and predates Method 3 + deep-only; keep it as the historical baseline only.

**Slippage pinned to 0 in the Pine (2026-07-23).** Both `mpc_strategy.pine` and `mpc_strategy_export.pine`
now declare `slippage = 0` in the `strategy()` call, so the TradingView Properties tab defaults to zero
instead of Aaron's old 25-tick setting. Reason: for HONEST parity the Pine's `fill_model="bar"` (zero
costs) must line up with a TV run that also charges nothing, so `compare_strategy.py` and a hand
trade-diff compare like-for-like. Real costs belong in the LAB's `fill_model="tick"` run (real bid/ask +
spread + slippage + commission + swap), not smeared as a flat 25-tick charge on every TV fill. The
breakeven buffer (`execBeBufTk`, default 30) is a STRATEGY input and is unchanged — it is signal logic,
not a cost. So the old note that TV's number is "slightly PESSIMISTIC because TV charges 25 ticks" no
longer applies to a fresh export: at slippage 0 the TV bar-mode number and our bar-mode number are the
honest apples-to-apples pair; the tick-mode lab run is the real tradeable number.

**When the Pine changes:** brother re-pastes `mpc_strategy.pine` → regenerate `mpc_strategy_export.pine`
(re-copy + re-append the parity block) → re-export → re-run until exit 0. A new trade-affecting input =
a new `config.py` field + a new `cfg_*` plot + a new `compare_strategy._TOGGLE_COLS` entry.

**One-shot sync check:** `backtest/tools/verify_parity.py <export.csv> [more.csv ...]` runs EVERY parity
check (all nine engines + this strategy) whose columns are present in the CSV(s) and prints one
GREEN/RED/SKIP table with auto-detected cold-start warmup. It is the "is everything in sync?" command
to run after any re-paste; it reports drift, it does not fix it (a real logic change is still a hand
port). Engines are the foundation — sync them first (`/audit-engines`), then this strategy.

## LOGIC parity vs RESULT parity — two different tools, two different questions

`compare_strategy.py` answers "is our CODE the Pine's code?" — it replays TradingView's OWN bars and
diffs the per-bar `px_*` decision stream, so the data feed is out of the equation. That is the gate.

`tools/compare_trades.py` answers a different question: "why does a LAB RUN's finished trade list
differ from what I got in the TradingView Strategy Tester?" It pairs the two trade lists by entry TIME
(not price — different brokers legitimately differ by cents on the same bar) and reports matched /
TV-only / ours-only. **It is a diagnosis tool, not a parity gate** — a diff here is usually the DATA
FEED, not the code (proven 2026-07-22: run `f455b21faabe` came in ~110% vs TradingView's 142%; the whole
gap was two longs Vantage's wick swept a level our PU-Prime feed's wick fell ~10 cents short of, so the
sweep never armed. `compare_strategy.py` was green on TradingView's bars, i.e. our code took both those
longs on Vantage data — the lab missed them purely on the feed). Two counting conventions also confuse
the comparison and are NOT bugs: TradingView counts each TP rung as its own "trade" (41 positions × 3
rungs = 123) and its max-DD % is vs peak equity where ours is vs starting capital. Usage:
`compare_trades.py <tv_trades.csv> <run_id>` — `--tz` defaults to `Etc/GMT+4` (the Vantage XAUUSD chart
is a FIXED UTC-4, no US DST); it prints a hint if the median pairing offset says otherwise.

## The 2026-07-16 year run — what the numbers actually say

365d, 15m, XAUUSD.s, `exec_risk_pct=10`, $10k start. Both fill models, same 22 trades:

| | bar (Pine guess, no costs) | tick (real bid/ask + costs) |
|---|---|---|
| net | $11,525.41 (115.25%) | **$11,374.78 (113.75%)** |
| PF | 4.426 | 4.228 |
| win% | 72.73% | 72.73% |

Real fills cost 1.3%; **0 bars fell back to the guess**, so every fill is a real tick. TradingView's
110.19% on the same setup is slightly PESSIMISTIC, not optimistic — TV charges a flat 25 ticks of
slippage on every fill, and the real broker is better than that (the entry is a resting limit, which
never slips; only stops pay).

**TradingView's 66 trades = our 22.** Each `strategy.exit` leg (TP1/TP2/runner) is a separate closed
trade in TV's stats: 22 × 3 = 66 exactly, and the filtered 16 winners × 3 = 48 exactly. Net / return /
drawdown mean the same thing in both; **profit factor and average-trade do NOT** — splitting one
winner into three legs changes the ratio (TV 4.155 vs the real 4.426). Don't compare those two.

**The distribution is the real story** (`|R| < 0.25` = scratch):

| outcome | n | $ pnl | % of net | avg R |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| reached the runner (TP1+TP2 banked) | 8 | +12,510 | **110%** | 1.19 |
| TP1 only, rest stopped at BE | 8 | +2,389 | 21% | 0.19 |
| never reached TP1 | 6 | −3,524 | −31% | −0.42 |

The 72.73% win rate is arithmetically right and analytically misleading: **10 of the 22 trades are
near-scratch** (together +$749), six of the eight "TP1 only" winners made under $300, only 2 trades
lost a full R (the stop→BE rule converts most losses to scratches), and the **top 3 trades are 57% of
net**. The edge is the runner. Treat the win rate as a byproduct of the BE stop, not as the edge.

### The 2-year run (2024-07-16 → 2026-07-16, tick mode) — the shape HOLDS

> **⚠️ Pre-combo baseline (superseded 2026-07-23).** Everything in this subsection was measured under
> the OLD default (divergence-armed, gap-edge entry, no deep-only). The shipped default is now the
> deep-entry combo (sweep-arm + deep-only + deep-fib → ≈+237%/PF6.2/85%/13%DD at 84 trades). The
> numbers below still stand as the divergence-only baseline, but they are no longer the default's
> results. Read them as history, not as what the bot does out of the box today.

40 trades, net **$21,536.60** on $10k. The distribution is the same story with a bigger sample:

| outcome | n | $ pnl | % of net | avg R |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| reached the runner | 15 | +26,565 | **123%** | 1.13 |
| TP1 only | 12 | +4,032 | 19% | 0.16 |
| never reached TP1 | 13 | −9,060 | −42% | −0.45 |

What the second year of data changed, and what it didn't:
- **Win rate fell 72.73% → 67.5%** (27/40) and losers went 6→13 — the 1-year window was the kinder half.
- **Concentration improved**: top 3 = 45% of net (was 57%) — still above the framework's <60% floor
  but no longer resting on three trades.
- **Still 17 of 40 near-scratch**, and still exactly the runner carrying everything (123% of net).
- **Full-R losses scale with the sample** (2 → 5), i.e. the stop→BE rule keeps converting most losses
  to scratches; that behaviour is stable, not a one-year artifact.
- **The ~83% short skew (33 shorts / 7 longs) is EXPLAINED as of 2026-07-16 — it is not a bug.**
  The port is parity-green, so the Pine skews identically. Measured per-side over the same 2yr
  window (48,246 bars, gold +75%):
  - **Root cause — the arm-source filter.** The sequence arms on a sweep OR a divergence, but
    `exec_arm_sweep` defaults **False**: only DIVERGENCE-armed setups may enter. Bearish
    divergences outnumber bullish **142:73 (66%)** in an uptrend — price keeps making higher
    highs on weakening RSI, while bullish divergences need lower lows a bull market rarely gives.
    The skew is inherited almost entirely from that 2:1. Sweeps, by contrast, are near-symmetric
    (1,505 S / 1,308 L), and the raw structure is *dead even* — external SOS is **125/125**. So
    nothing upstream of the arm filter is asymmetric.
  - **Amplified by fib geometry.** Episodes reaching Stage 4 READY: **37 L vs 67 S**. After a bull
    SOS a long waits for a retrace to 0.5/0.618 — in a strong uptrend the pullback is too shallow
    to reach it (51 long episodes die at peak stage 2, vs 25 short), while the deep counter-trend
    rallies a short setup needs arrive reliably.
  - **The default filter is the profitable subset, and it is a strict SUBSET.** Every
    divergence-armed trade is also sweep-armed, so `both` is bit-identical to `sweep only`.
    Arm source → trades / short% / net / PF (bar mode, 2yr, no costs):
    divergence-only (OLD default) 40 / 82.5% / +190% / **3.27** · sweep-only (= both) 79 / 69.6% /
    +144% / **1.87**. Enabling sweeps adds 39 trades that lose money net and drags PF down ~43%.
  - **Longs are not broken, just rare** — 7 trades, **86% win**, profitable (+21% of capital).
    Nothing is blocking longs incorrectly; there simply are few bullish divergences up here.
  - **What to actually worry about is concentration, not the count.** Shorts carry **89% of net**.
    Every HTF bias filter is `Ignore` (`exec_htf_weekly`/`exec_htf_daily`), so this is an
    unfiltered counter-trend fade that shorted a +75% bull market and won at 70%. That is the
    claim needing a second regime to confirm — the direction split itself is now accounted for.

Open threads (Aaron is on the edge work as of 2026-07-16): ~~whether stop→BE on TP1 caps runners~~
(**ANSWERED 2026-07-26, Run 3 in `mpc_sos_fade_optimization.md`: it does not — it pays for itself**); and
why 15m is reportedly the only winning timeframe (a real edge usually survives on neighbouring
timeframes — if 5m and 30m lose, suspect luck). 40 trades is still a thin sample; treat the KPIs as
directional, not settled. (Superseded note: an earlier version warned "do not flip `exec_arm_sweep` — it
breaks parity". That was wrong on the mechanism — parity is driven by the export's `cfg_bits`, not the
default — and moot now: the default flipped to sweep-arm on 2026-07-23, in lockstep across both Pine
files and `config.py`, so parity holds. Flip toggles freely per run; just keep the two Pine files and
`config.py` defaults identical when you change a DEFAULT.)

## Tests

```
command-center/backend/.venv/bin/python -m pytest strategies/python/mpc_sos_fade/tests/ -q
```
Offline, no network, no TradingView. `test_sequence.py` (state machine on the real engine stack +
hand-checked Pine rules), `test_execution.py` (fills / ladder / stop-out / sizing, hand-checked),
`test_strategy_driver.py` (end-to-end), `test_compare_strategy.py` (the parity tool round-trips its
own output). These prove the plumbing; the Pine diff is the live gate.

## The B-LEG bot reuses this one — three parity-safe additions (2026-07-24, do NOT revert)

`strategies/python/mpc_bleg/` (the standalone B-LEG bot) reuses this package's engine + A+ sequence +
fill machinery, so it needed three ADDITIVE, decision-neutral changes here. All three are safe (this
bot's offline tests stay green) and must not be reverted:

1. **`signals.py`** — `Signals` gained `bull_bos_high/low` + `bear_bos_high/low` (the break-leg
   endpoints the B-LEG band-freeze reads). Nothing in the A+ path reads them.
2. **`sequence.py`** — `SeqState` gained `bleg_arm_l`/`bleg_arm_s`, computed at the EXACT Pine point:
   after the opposite-SOS death, BEFORE the continuation-BOS death clears `l_sos_bar` and before the
   half/618 latch update. The B leg arms off state that `update()` has already cleared by the time it
   returns, so the sequence has to expose it here.
3. **`execution.py`** — the A+ arm decision was extracted from `_place_entries` into `_armed()` (a pure
   refactor) so the B-LEG subclass can reuse the "A+ has priority" gate. No behaviour change.

Full context in `strategies/python/mpc_bleg/CLAUDE.md`.

## Do / Never

- **Do** port any change to `mpc_strategy.pine`'s A+ block or execution layer here line-for-line, then
  re-run `compare_strategy.py`. Keep the Pine the source of truth — never edit it to match the Python.
- **Do** read engine OUTPUT only (`backtest.replay` `BarState`) — never reach into an engine's internals.
- **Never** build a second copy of any engine here — this consumes the canonical `engines/`.
- **Never** trust a backtest number until `compare_strategy.py` is exit 0 on a fresh export.
- **Never** commit a real TradingView export or backtest cache into git.

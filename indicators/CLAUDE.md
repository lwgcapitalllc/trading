# CLAUDE.md — indicators/

**Purpose:** From-scratch Pine Script rebuild of the "Structure OS / SMC Engine" market-structure indicator (swing highs/lows, HH/HL/LH/LL, BOS, CHoCH), replicating a private TradingView indicator's behavior using a pullback-only detection method.
**Scope:** This covers Pine Script indicator development and the market-structure detection engine only. It does NOT cover trading strategy logic, risk management, or any live/backtest execution — this is a charting indicator, not a bot.
**Status:** Under construction — Stage 2b (break-gated swing structure + BOS/CHoCH) is ~95% validated against the original; Stage 3 (internal structure) and Stage 4 (multi-symbol/timeframe comparison) not started. Blocked on chart validation by Aaron before Stage 3 begins.
**Last reviewed:** 2026-06-20

## Key paths & entry points

- `indicators/smc_engine_v2.pine` — the current pullback-only rewrite (v6 Pine Script), overlay indicator named "SMC Engine"
- `indicators/STRUCTURE_OS_BUILD.md` — cross-session handoff doc: architecture, design decisions, validation findings, build-stage status. Read this first when resuming work.
- `docs/market_structure_engine_spec.md` — the source-of-truth rules spec, written from the TradingView overview page. `STRUCTURE_OS_BUILD.md` treats this as priority-1 source of truth.

## Standing instructions

**Do**
- Confirm swings only by the 3-candle pullback method: a swing high needs 3 consecutive candles each closing below the previous candle's low; a swing low needs 3 consecutive candles each closing above the previous candle's high.
- Reset the pullback count to zero at a new extreme if price prints a new high (while seeking a high) or new low (while seeking a low) before the count reaches 3.
- Keep detection to a single fixed constant (3). No numeric tuning inputs for detection.
- Reuse the same shared pullback-tracker type (`type PB`) for both the swing (external) engine and the internal engine — instantiate it twice, don't fork the logic.
- Gate new swing structure on a body-close break of the current trading range (BOS/CHoCH), per the corrected Stage 2b architecture — do not let swings form freely inside the range.
- Update `STRUCTURE_OS_BUILD.md` status/changelog as each stage is validated on a real chart.

**Never do**
- Do not use `ta.pivothigh` / `ta.pivotlow` or any fixed-lookback-window pivot method to detect swings.
- Do not add numeric/tunable inputs for the detection logic itself — it must stay a zero-parameter mechanical rule.
- Do not fork the shared `PB` pullback-tracker type into two separate code paths for swing vs. internal — if the two ever need to diverge, branch inside `PB` with a flag instead.
- Do not build or validate Stage 2/3 logic on top of an unvalidated swing map — the swing detector is the foundation; get it confirmed against the real chart first.
- Do not treat a wick-only touch of a range boundary as a break — only a candle body close beyond the boundary counts (BOS/CHoCH).

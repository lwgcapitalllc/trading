# Notes — The 2026-07-31 harness pass — four exports validated

The harness validation pass across four exports, the file it deleted, the session-window refork, and the two FVG-export holes that would each have produced a misleading green. Moved VERBATIM out of `indicators/CLAUDE.md` on 2026-09-13 so it loads only when
needed; nothing was reworded or dropped. **New detail on this topic goes HERE**, and the
CLAUDE.md gets at most one index line.

## 2026-07-31 — the harness pass: four exports validated, one file deleted, session windows finally forked back together

**`mpc_jarvis_v2.pine` DELETED** (Aaron's call). It was a 2,084-line lean `indicator()`
build superseded by `sos_fade_strategy_export.pine`. Last committed at **`825592a`** — recover from there,
never from memory. All doc references removed in the same pass.

**The session windows were forked and nobody had noticed.** `sos_fade_strategy.pine` has carried the
DST-aware windows since **2026-07-12** (`317dbef`) — two weeks BEFORE `mpc_jarvis.pine` got them
(`b25789d`, 07-26) — but `b_leg_strategy.pine` and `b_leg_strategy_export.pine` never did, so
the SOS Fade and B-LEG forks disagreed about when a session opens. That breaks this file's own standing
rule: an engine-block change in the parent flows to the fork line-for-line.

| | old (fixed offset) | new (own city, DST-aware) |
|---|---|---|
| Tokyo  | `2000-0500` GMT-4 | `0900-1800` **Asia/Tokyo** |
| London | `0400-1300` GMT-4 | `0800-1700` **Europe/London** |
| New York | `0900-1800` GMT-4 | `0800-1700` **America/New_York** |

**It is trade-affecting in principle, not cosmetic** — session H/L feed `recentBSL`/`recentSSL`
(`sos_fade_strategy.pine:3121-3126`), which is what `execArmSweep` arms SOS Fade on, and that toggle is ON in the
shipped prime combo. The path is narrow (`showSessH = liq_dh == ""` makes session levels a FALLBACK
used only when no day level exists) but narrow is not none. **Measured, not assumed: neither bot
moves** — `compare_strategy.py --warmup 100` and `compare_bleg.py --warmup 100` both still exit 0.

**Then proven on a FRESH export, which is the run that actually tests the fix.** The paragraph above
was measured against the 2026-07-29 B-LEG export, taken off the Pine *before* its windows changed — a
green there says the Python side is self-consistent, not that the sync is right.
`compare_bleg.py "VANTAGE_XAUUSD, 15_cabec.csv" --warmup 800` → **exit 0**, 6,329 bars,
2026-04-27 → 2026-07-31. **The window matters more than the bar count here:** it sits entirely inside
BST/EDT, which is the half of the year where the new city-clock windows and the old fixed GMT-4 ones
genuinely disagree (New York `0800-1700` America/New_York = 12:00–21:00 UTC under EDT, an hour earlier
than the old `0900-1800` GMT-4). A stale Python side would have disagreed with Pine on every session
boundary in this export. `svp_export.pine` was re-exported in the same pass and `compare_svp.py
--warmup 317` exits 0 on 12,117 bars, so the "re-expression, not a behaviour change" claim about Asia
is now measured too.

⚠ **Compile status after that pass, stated exactly.** `b_leg_strategy_export.pine` and
`svp_export.pine` both compiled — Aaron exported from them, which is stronger evidence than a paste.
`b_leg_strategy.pine` is body-identical to its export apart from the line-40 title, so it is
covered by construction. **`m15_playbook.pine` was never pasted after its windows were edited
and now never will be — it was DELETED on 2026-08-15** (Aaron's call; the note is in
`engines/CLAUDE.md`). ⚠ **It was described here as his BROTHER'S work in progress**, so the six
edited session strings in it were never compiled by anyone and that question closes unanswered
rather than resolved. The surviving files carrying the same block are listed below.

Synced in `b_leg_strategy.pine`, `b_leg_strategy_export.pine` and `m15_playbook.pine`
(each file's own `display = display.none` preserved — only the six values changed; the third of
those was deleted 2026-08-15).
⚠ **That deleted file's NY window had been `0900-1700`**, unlike every other file's `0900-1800` — a
pre-existing difference of unknown origin, folded into the common `0800-1700` by the sync. It was
his BROTHER's in-progress file and the question of whether that hour was deliberate was never put
to him; the file is gone, so the question is now moot rather than answered. `svp_export.pine` was re-stated too, purely for
consistency: `"2000-0500" GMT-4` and `"0900-1800" Asia/Tokyo` are the SAME 00:00-09:00 UTC window all
year, which is exactly why `engines/session_volume_profile/` needed no code change.

**Do this as a line-targeted edit, never a global string replace.** In these files the OLD Tokyo value
(`"2000-0500"`) and the OLD New York value (`"0900-1800"`) collide with the NEW Tokyo value, so a naive
substitution rewrites Tokyo and then immediately overwrites it again when the New York rule runs.
Anchor every edit on its `*_SESSION_GROUP`.

### `fvg_export.pine` — two holes that would each have produced a MISLEADING green

1. **It plotted 6 array slots against a cap of 8**, so gaps 7 and 8 were live in Pine and invisible to
   the diff — every earlier FVG "exit 0" covered the oldest six only. Now 10 slots, `fvgMaxCount`
   capped at 10 to match, and `compare_fvg.py` REFUSES an export whose `cfg_fvg_maxcount` exceeds the
   plotted slots rather than reporting partial coverage.
2. **Its minimum-gap floor was one flat number** while mpc's is timeframe-split
   (`mpc_jarvis.pine:410-412`: `0.0` below 900s, `0.04` at 15m+). Exported on 15m the old build
   would still have gone GREEN — both sides read the setting from `cfg_fvg_thresh` — while running a
   DIFFERENT rule from the indicator it mirrors. It now carries `fvgThreshLTF`/`fvgThreshHTF` and the
   same `timeframe.in_seconds() < 900` ternary; `cfg_fvg_thresh` plots the EFFECTIVE value, so the
   comparator needed no change. Proven both ways: the 15m export read back **0.04**, the 5m **0.0**.

### The four harnesses, validated on two grand exports

`sessions_export.pine`, `liquidity_export.pine`, `ob_export.pine` and `fvg_export.pine` were put on
ONE chart and exported together — 146 columns, **no column-name collisions between the four**, so all
four comparators run off a single CSV. Both runs exit 0 on every check:

| export | bars | window | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VANTAGE_XAUUSD, 15m` | 21,691 | 2025-09-01 → 2026-07-31 | spans **four DST changeovers** — the real test of the window re-sync |
| `VANTAGE_XAUUSD, 5m` | 13,186 | 2026-05-27 → 2026-07-31 | covers the NY opening range, which is a ≤5m feature |

**Take the DST-spanning export on the COARSER timeframe.** TradingView caps an export near 20k bars,
so 15m spans a changeover and 5m may not — the opposite of the instinct to always export fine.
`sessions_export.pine` is the one harness that needs both: everything in it is timeframe-agnostic
except the NY opening range, which reads a 5-minute `request.security`. `compare_sessions.py` now
measures the export's bar interval, warns before running, and takes `--skip-nyr` (printing a **NOT
CHECKED** line on success as well as failure).
